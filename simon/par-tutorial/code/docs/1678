Is Munich really that bad? FP'ers at LMU and TUM, please speak up.
(I know that at least research-wise there are quite a few around there,
though I don't know what they do in teaching.)

Less than 200 km from Munich: 
http://db.inf.uni-tuebingen.de/teaching/ws1112/afp

Also, Germany extends farther than 200 km beyond Munich. :-)

Say, Bonn:

The thread Sean pointed to may provide information on that. Obvious
candidates are Utrecht and Chalmers, both teaching in English I suppose,
at least at Master level.

Best,
