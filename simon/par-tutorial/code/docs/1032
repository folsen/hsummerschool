Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Additional functions of GMP
Message-ID: <op.vz1s8vk7shvy2l@artyom-nbook>

GMP has a lot of functions, such as extracting roots, primality test,  
Legendre symbol, factorial and so on. These can be written in Haskell, of  
course, but isn't it better to use existing functions? They are also much  
faster than similar functions from NumericPrelude, I believe.

I have heard GHC 7.2.1 now includes module named GHC.Integer.Logarithms,  
but I can't find its description anywhere.

So, my question is: can I use full power of GMP's functions, and if I can  
? how?
