I don't know why Hoogle didn't find one of the packages.  I've often
wondered about this related question:

   * Is there a place to browse the union of all namespaces in all hackage
packages?

This would show the global Haskell/Hackage  namespace as it currently
stands and I think would be useful for a number of different purposes.
