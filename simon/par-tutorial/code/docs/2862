It feels to me like a quite reasonable simplification that if someone
wants to offer different bits of code, with the intent that the license
terms of the eventual executable may be different depending on which
bits you use, then they ought to do so in different packages.  It's
simple enough to do, and removes the need to do per-module license
considerations.
