This no longer points to a hakyll problem, not even a cabal problem per 
se. This is a problem with package inconsistencies you already have; 
cabal merely does garbage-in garbage-out.

The output of "ghc -v" will display wonders.

The output of "ghc-pkg list -v" will also be of help.

If you are interested in not treating package databases as a black box 
plug-and-play appliance that "just works" (clearly, it doesn't), see my
