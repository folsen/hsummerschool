Subject: [Haskell-cafe] installing/reinstalling haskell platform with
	profiling enabled on windows
Message-ID: <CABypoYyzya+16obfF1VmdzJhG8ZHsTXTa238KF+9gcYiq4DEyQ@mail.gmail.com>

How can I install/reinstall haskell platform with profiling enabled on
windows?
Or the other way to put it, how can I install/reinstall haskell platform on
windows with my own cabal options?

I googled on it and didn't find any solutions for windows OS.
Thanks,

Malik
