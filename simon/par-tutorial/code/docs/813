Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Haskell Weekly News: Issue 179
Message-ID: <BANLkTimxkvAMRZhhY0MiEMXnMAvMFYcs5g@mail.gmail.com>

   Welcome to issue 179 of the HWN, a newsletter covering developments in
   the Haskell community. This release covers the week of April 16 to 23, 2011.

Announcements

   Alex Mason announced (http://goo.gl/2qtyM) the second annual
   Australian Haskell Hackathon to be heald from Friday July 8th to
   Sunday July 10th, at the UNSW's Computer Science building in
   Sydney. Come share with your fellow Australasian Haskellers!

   "The Hac" team invited us (http://goo.gl/8EQfI) to HacPhi 2011, a
   Haskell hackathon/get-together to be held July 29 to 31 at the
   University of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia. Daniel Wagner wanted
   to stress that "everyone is welcome--you do not have to be a
   Haskell guru. Helping hack on someone else's project could be a
   great way to increase your Haskell-fu."

   Robert Clausecker asked "Is Hugs dead?" (http://goo.gl/639dC). Sad
   to see projects of this sort fade into the past.
