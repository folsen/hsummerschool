Hi Michael,

well, Thomas DuBuisson and I talked about it couple of days ago, and i'm probably
going to incorporate AES into cryptocipher directly, so dropping the dependancy
problem.

I'm not a big fan of the C implementation, so i'll be looking into replacing it by
an implementation i made couple of years back (providing it's at least providing the
same level of performance), and adding support to AES-NI (although I've heard that
someone else might be working into that as well).
