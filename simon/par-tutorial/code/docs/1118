Not at all. Types with Monoid instances need an additional
instance, a Semgroup instance, in order to be able to use '<>' instead
of mappend. mconcat is not involved in this discussion.

That is the current situation. I am advocating leaving it that way.

Exporting <> from Data.Monoid is the intrusive change. I am strongly
against it. In the long run, it will create ugliness and inconvenience
to our class system, which has enough problems as it is. I advocate leaving
things as they are.

If individual library authors wish to add a Semigroup instance to their
Monoid instances as a convenience, which is harmless, I think that
would be wonderful. But that is a separate issue.

Thanks,
Yitz
