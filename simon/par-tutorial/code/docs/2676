I am a relative newcomer to Haskell, but I think I have a reasonable
understanding of the executaion model. Enough to fix performance
issues in simple code like the example given.

However, one of the Haskell projects I work on is Ben Lippmeier's
DDC compiler. Thats about 50000 lines of Haskell code and finding
performance issues there is really difficult.
