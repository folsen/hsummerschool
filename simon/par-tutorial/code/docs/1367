Subject: [Haskell-cafe] haskell-src-exts should depend on happy
Message-ID: <CALzazPCqXV=poAzXbc7eNhSj4yugq6yR7Pigk+_eONKi_35xRw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

cabal installing haskell-src-exts fails, because of an unlisted dependency
to the happy executable.

The following succeeds:

cabal install happy; cabal install haskell-src-exts

Thanks,
Ozgur
