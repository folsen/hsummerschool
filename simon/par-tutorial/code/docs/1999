Okay, so inserting the phrases "that either fail eventually or" and "that succeed forever if they do not immediately fail" so that that the documentation reads:

   -- [Warning]: This is only defined for actions that either fail immediately or that eventually fail
   -- after being performed repeatedly, such as parsing. For pure values such
   -- as 'Maybe' that succeed forever if they do not immediately fail, this will cause an infinite loop.

makes the situation more clear.

Cheers,
Greg
