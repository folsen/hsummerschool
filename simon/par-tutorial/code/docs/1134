Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Evolving faster Haskell programs - where are the
	files?
Message-ID: <1313356406.2070.4.camel@robert-ThinkPad-R500>

I just read the enlightening article by Don Stewart[1], and wanted to
test this method on one of my own programs, but it seems that there some
of the attached files are missing, namely [2], [3] and [4]. Is there
anybody who knows, where I can get those files? I don't really want to
rewrite those file by hand.

Yours, Robert Clausecker
