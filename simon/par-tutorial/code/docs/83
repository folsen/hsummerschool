Subject: [Haskell-cafe] [ANNOUNCE] Data-flow based graph algorithms
Message-ID: <BANLkTimkfvJJKg7O5=saAvcfs-vDv1Uorw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

Based on my Etage data-flow framework:

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Etage

I have made a package to show how to implement graph algorithms on top of it:

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Etage-Graph

I invite everybody to take a look and see how it is possible to
implement known control-flow algorithms in a data-flow manner. For
now, only shortest paths search is implemented (from all to all
nodes). The nice feature is that such approach is easily parallelized.

It quite heavily uses Haskell threads so it is also useful to
benchmark and test them, especially for graphs with many nodes (>
300).

There is documentation, but because of this bug it is not visible:
