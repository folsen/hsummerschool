The PEPM Symposium/Workshop series brings together researchers
and practitioners working in the broad area of program
transformation, which spans from refactoring, partial evaluation,
supercompilation, fusion and other metaprogramming to model-driven
development, program analyses including termination, inductive
programming, program generation and applications of machine learning 
and probabilistic search. PEPM focuses on techniques, supporting
theory, tools, and applications of the analysis and manipulation of
programs. 

In addition to the presentations of regular research papers, the PEPM
program includes tool demonstrations and `short paper' presentations
of exciting if not fully polished research.

PEPM has established a Best Paper award. The winner will be 
announced at the workshop.
