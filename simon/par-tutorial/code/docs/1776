Indeed, the community server (including trac) is administered on a volunteer best-effort basis.  Unfortunately, we do not have sufficient trac-admin expertise on the volunteer team in order to know what is wrong here, or to fix it.  If there is a trac expert out there who could help us diagnose and fix the problem, we would be glad of their aid.
