And so are imaginary numbers. But they are damn useful for electrical circuits calculations, so who cares?

What do you mean by "interpretation"?

But they ARE very similar to other values. They can be members of otherwise meaningful structures, and you can do calculations with these structures. "fst (1, _|_)" is a good and meaningful calculation.

So, (_|_) is bad, but (1, _|_) is good?

You know, my scientific advisor used to say "math is about calling different things by the same name; philosophy is about calling the same thing by different names". It seems to me that philosophy is something you're doing now, whereas programming is all about math.

Sure, but if you've ever used recursion, then you do have bottoms in your program.
