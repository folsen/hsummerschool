Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Deriving laws by systematic transformations
Message-ID: <CAHjViWJ5F-HzZQd==hNsjL=4d272JYDkXY_iBRjpYahkVhSv9A@mail.gmail.com>

Studying Wadler's "Comprehending Monads" and "Theorems for free!",
I've been unable to derive law (iv) and I'm not sure about (iii). Will
appreciate a pointer to similar examples or a massive hint. Here's my
attempt at (iii):

map f . unit x = map f [x]
                     = [f x]
                     = unit (f x)
                     = (unit . f) x
map f . unit = unit .f
