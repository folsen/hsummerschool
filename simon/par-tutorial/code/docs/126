It's just that on some platforms/Haskell implementations the Haskell
Double/Float may not line up with the C side.  If you use CDouble/CFloat it
will line up.  Compared to unsafeCoerce, I would hope you'd get a C compile
error on those platforms, but I don't know for certain if that's the case.

In my opinion, it's the conversion functions that need to be fixed.
