Page 7:

By the way, why did Church choose the notation "?"? In [an unpublished
letter to Harald Dickson, Church] stated clearly that it came from the
notation "x?" used for class-abstraction by Whitehead and Russell, by first
modifying "x?" to "? x" to distinguish functionabstraction from
class-abstraction, and then changing "? " to "?" for ease of printing.
This origin was also reported in [Rosser. Highlights of the history of the
lambda calculus. Annals of the History of Computing]. On the other hand,
in his later years Church told two enquirers that the choice was more
accidental: a symbol was needed and "?" just happened to be chosen.)
