Are you familiar with Roel van Djik's revdep Hackage?
http://bifunctor.homelinux.net/~roel/hackage/packages/hackage.html

It's usually quite up to date, and very useful.

Last I heard was that Matt Gruen had done quite a lot of work on it in
the last Summer of Code (see http://cogracenotes.wordpress.com/), but
they haven't got around to actually deploying the new version - but
that was a few months ago.

Cheers,
