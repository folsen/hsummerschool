Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Hardware description in Haskell.
Message-ID: <CABFQQ=C0ybeTt8mSi_d43FGHL+hCA6=_SwBLVD4AwLN9SCYoJw@mail.gmail.com>

I would like to introduce my over-than-two years long project, HHDL:

http://thesz.mskhug.ru/svn/hhdl/hackage/hhdl/

(I prefer to pronounce it as a ha-ha-dee-el, this way it is more fun)

It allows one to create digital hardware description in Haskell and
then generate VHDL code (Verilog is on the way). Okay, it would allow
one to do all that some day. I hope it will come sooner than later.

I try to make all wires as typed as I can and to support algebraic
types with patetrn matching. I wrote a simple example to demonstrate
some of those facilities:

http://thesz.mskhug.ru/svn/hhdl/hackage/hhdl/src/Hardware/HHDL/Examples/RunningSumMaybes.hs

This is a simple accumulator that accepts a Maybe Word8 input. The
resulting VHDL is very wordy, but looks superficially correct.

I wrote two posts about HHDL:

http://thesz.livejournal.com/1284055.html - slightly outdated as HHDL
now generates VHDL that typechecks and allows one to name inputs and
outputs
http://thesz.livejournal.com/1284541.html - motivation behind HHDL

There is no package for Hackage, because I do not feel HHDL is worth
it right now. For example, I tested it on ghc 6.12.1, not later
versions, the library code is messy. But HHDL is good enough for some
scrutiny and critique by Haskell users who is into hardware
description.
