Subject: [Haskell-cafe]  Split function
Message-ID: <AANLkTikno_NYzOG0omQFPptaBqhsGOXaxdD3AhD+GK4U@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

Is this a good implementation of split function? ... I was wondering about
the "lines" function, it basically a special case of split right?

split c xs = foldr f [[]] xs
where
f x list@(l:ls)= if x == c then []:list else (x:l):ls


Regards,
Kashyap
