Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Haskell Weekly News: Issue 177
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=cL-AvZJO2mto1wOA_jmEK=rfR2Q@mail.gmail.com>

   Welcome to issue 177 of the HWN, a newsletter covering developments in
   the [1]Haskell community. This release covers the week of April 3 to 9,
   2011.

Announcements

   Brent Yorgey [2]sent out a call for contributions for the second
   edition of Typeclassopedia.

   Roel van Dijk started what became a popular[3]thread on the mailing
   list about encodings of Haskell source files.

   What would you like to see here? I have gotten mixed feedback on what
   constitutes interesting items for the "announcements" section of the
   mailing list. Some have pointed out that package announcements tend to
   be noisy and not all that interesting to the community at large, or
   that have a bias towards only pointing out packages where the
   maintainer decides to send an email to the mailing list. What do *you*
   think? How about the "calls for papers"? Do those catch your attention?
   Let me hear what you think.

Quotes of the Week

     * ion: It?s a well-known historical fact cave men writing Haskell
       hated the ASCII pseudoglyphs.

     * shapr: I persuaded academics to show up and hang out. [...] I told
       the academics that there were academics worth chatting with on
       #haskell :-)

     * pjscott: If you really want to see something ridiculous, try
       looking at the auto-generated library documentation for anything
       involving regular expressions. The type declarations in
       Text.Regex.TDFA are like something H. P. Lovecraft might write
       about.

     * monochrom: the road to haskell is paved with good abstractions
