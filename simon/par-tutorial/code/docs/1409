I meant if you're trying to *implement* serialisation. The Bits class 
allows you to access bits one by one, but surely you'd want some way to 
know how many bits you need to keep?

Likewise, you say the standard PRNG can be used to generate random 
Integers, but what if you're trying to implement a new PRNG?
