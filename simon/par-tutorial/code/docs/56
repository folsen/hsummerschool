I don't see any problems with this approach if you have only hundreds
of agents, especially because GHC 7 is a lot faster when using many
threads.  However, if you want hundreds of thousands of agents, maybe
this won't work, but I don't really know what kinds of limits GHC has
8-).  That said, it may be difficult to do better than GHC's scheduler
;-).

Cheers! =)
