Subject: [Haskell-cafe] llvm package on Windows
Message-ID: <4D992D27.3090602@mcmaster.ca>

I am trying to install llvm-0.9.0.1 on Windows (through cygwin), on top 
of a clean install of Haskell Platform 2010.2.0.0.

I do
cabal install llvm --configure-option --with-llvm-prefix="C:\\llvm"
(which is where I unpacked llvm-gcc4.2-2.8-x86-mingw43.tar.bz2).  This 
fails with

.....mingw\bin\ld.exe: cannot find -lLLVMXCoreAsmPrinter
(which is indeed the first -l option on the gcc line).

[I also tried the llvm-ht package, same issue; I can't tell which of the 
2 packages is 'best' from the online doc]

Perhaps I need to 'install' llvm more thoroughly?  [Most of the 
instructions online seem to assume you want to use llvm-gcc, which is 
not my case]

Any clues?

Jacques
