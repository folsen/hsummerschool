Think of the simplest version of the problem that isn't totally trivial.

e.g. A one dimensional list of numbers.

What would you do?

Note: you only want to touch each element once.

The 2 dimensional case could be handled by putting into lists: rows,
columns, major diagonals, and minor diagonals.

This isn't the fastest way of doing the problem but it has the
advantage of avoiding "indexitis".
