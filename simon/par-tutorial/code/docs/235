Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Parsing HTML tables with HXT
Message-ID: <BANLkTimi4H8j6AmFsbwmHJ1MUHKDd8do9A@mail.gmail.com>

Dear Cafe,

Can someone please help me with getting the value of the table cell with HXT
in the following html:

<table class="tblc">
<tr>
  <td class="tdc">x</td>
  <td>y</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td class="tdc">a</td>
  <td>b</td>
</tr>
</table>

I need the value of the second cell in a row that has first cell with some
predefined value (in the example above it can be x or a) I need the arrow of
the type (IOSArrow XmlTree String) How to write it?

Thanks
