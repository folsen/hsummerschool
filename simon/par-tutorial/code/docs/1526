I had similar problems when trying to profile an executable that was 
using certain parts of the GHC API [1]. If you are using parts of
the GHC API that are related to the GHCi profiling API bug [2],
then you will get errors/segfaults. AFAIK, a better error message
was never implemented for GHC API users, only for building GHCi in
profiling mode.
