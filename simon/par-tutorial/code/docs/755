Based on tests I did before iteratee-0.4, the fastest implementation was
Oleg's alternate design which is in the comments of IterateeM.hs.  I don't
think any current packages use that however, with good reason.

I'd be interested to see the results of a shootout between iteratee and
enumerator.  I would expect them to be basically equivalent most of the
time, with maybe two or three operations with a small (but consistent)
difference one way or the other.
