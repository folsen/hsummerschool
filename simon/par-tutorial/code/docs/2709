I'm moderately in favor of making the primary supported platform x86_64,
except for the distribution issue.  If i386 were maintained but not
necessarily targeted for improvement that would be fine by me.

For my code, x86_64 (OS X) is a net win.  It's sometimes significantly
faster, and hasn't ever been noticeably slower. The biggest gains seems to
be I/O, although I haven't really investigated this.
