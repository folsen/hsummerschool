Can't you use cabal as a library to do this?

I had a crack at figuring out a ghci command line in TBC (testing by convention):

https://github.com/peteg/TBC

while waiting for this cabal feature to be implemented:

http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/382

Apparently there's a GSoC project that will nail this.

You can fire up TBC with the verbose flag and it will give you a very long ghc invocation line that is strongly similar to what cabal uses to compile your project. It doubtlessly is incomplete, and probably bit rotten. I will try to make it work with the latest Haskell Platform release in the coming weeks.

I welcome patches, but you're better off fixing cabal itself.

cheers
