Subject: [Haskell-cafe] cab 0.1.2
Message-ID: <20110408.111941.138805822.kazu@iij.ad.jp>

Hello cafe,

Let me announce "cab version 0.1.2". This version integrates
"cabal-dev" as well as "cabal/ghc-pkg". So, you can use a sandbox for
your development.

	http://www.mew.org/~kazu/proj/cab/en/

Here is the short explanation from the page above:

----
"cab" is a MacPorts-like maintenance command of Haskell cabal
packages. Some parts of this program are a wrapper to "ghc-pkg",
"cabal", and "cabal-dev".

If you are always confused due to inconsistency of "ghc-pkg" and
"cabal", or if you want a way to check all outdated packages, or if
you want a way to remove outdated packages recursively, this command
helps you.

"cab" is designed to maintain user packages only assuming that users
use a Haskell Platform and don't want to touch the global packages.
