Call for Participation
======================

                              PLPV 2012
                     The Sixth ACM SIGPLAN Workshop 
            Programming Languages meets Program Verification 

24th January, 2012
Philadelphia, USA
(Affiliated with POPL 2012)
http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/nswamy/plpv12
         
You are cordially invited to PLPV 2012.  

The goal of PLPV is to foster and stimulate research at the intersection of programming languages and program verification, by bringing together experts from diverse areas like types, contracts, interactive theorem proving, model checking and program analysis. Work in this area typically attempts to reduce the burden of program verification by taking advantage of particular semantic or structural properties of the programming language. Examples include dependently typed programming languages, which leverage a language's type system to specify and check richer than usual specifications or extended static checking systems which incorporate contracts with either static or dynamic contract checking.
