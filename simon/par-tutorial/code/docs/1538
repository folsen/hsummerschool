I know of several places where I can ask maths questions and half a 
dozen people will take guesses at what the correct solution might be. I 
haven't yet found anywhere where I can say "when would a chi-squared 
test be more appropriate than a KS test?" and get an informed, 
knowledgeable answer. (Answers from people who /know/ what they're 
talking about rather than just /think/ they know.)

Anyway, from this thread I've got the names of a few places to start 
looking. And that's really what I was hoping for. Thanks for the tips.
