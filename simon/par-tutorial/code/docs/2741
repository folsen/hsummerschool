Has a request gone out yet? I didn't notice anything (maybe it got
lost in all the recent haskell.org downtime), and the current Hackage
page of xhtml is still listing Bjorn.

Anyway, John MacFarlane has found a workaround which he's implemented
in HEAD Pandoc (http://code.google.com/p/pandoc/issues/detail?id=134);
from http://groups.google.com/group/pandoc-discuss/browse_frm/thread/915586b5c5e264b6#

This may be useful for other people to know. (There are quite a few
users of xhtml:
