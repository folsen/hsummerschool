I was just looking into the same thing.  This link at Rosetta Code has
a list shuffling function, which is my first experiment with mutable
Vectors:

    http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Balanced_brackets#Haskell

The list is converted to a mutable Vector, the mapM_ performs a series
of element swaps, then the result is frozen and converted back to a
list.
