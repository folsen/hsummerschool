No joy: hakyll itself requires unix 2.4, so the following are discarded:  unix-2.0, 2.2.0.0, 2.3.0.0, 2.3.1.0, 2.3.2.0,

However, that's the only unix discard before the error occurs somewhat later on, only now the error is not with unix but with array (which is not discarded by anything):

Its starting to look like there's something very wrong with cabal databases.  My first thought is to remove my local version, but I'm hesitant because I do have other haskell work I'm in progress on that isn't broken and I don't want to break it.  :-)

No joy there either.  There were some preliminary package version complaints that I tried to resolve, but the end result is:

$ cabal install cabal-dev
