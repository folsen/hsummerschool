Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANN: case-insensitive-0.1
Message-ID: <AANLkTin_5Fy2juPCHEc9PLg8-C6Pn3iiDE+mSqHM77pE@mail.gmail.com>

Dear all,

I had this old module laying around that I wrote some time ago. I
dusted it off and uploaded it to Hackage:

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/case-insensitive-0.1

The package provides the module Data.CaseInsensitive which exports the
CI type constructor which can be parameterised by a string-like type
like: String, ByteString, Text, etc.. Comparisons of values of the
resulting type are then insensitive to cases.

It is my hope that one day packages like snap-core[1], http-types[2]
or wai[3] all use this common way of making strings case insensitive.

Regards,

Bas
