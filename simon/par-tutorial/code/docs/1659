Subject: [Haskell-cafe] GHCi and Cairo on Windows
Message-ID: <20111205002348.11646cdsx9ebots8@webmail.oregonstate.edu>

In effort to keep my work cross-platform, I am trying to get GHCi and  
Cairo working together nicely on Windows (as a back-end to Diagrams,  
if it matters.) When loading the library in GHCi I get the following  
error:

Loading package cairo-0.12.2 ... linking ... ghc: unable to load  
package `cairo-0.12.2'

I am able to build, link, and execute successfully using 'ghc --make'  
so I know the libraries are installed correctly. I'm using GHC as  
packaged in the most recent version of the Haskell Platform and the  
most recent all-in-one Windows bundle of GTK.

I've seen quite similar errors reported months ago with no apparent solution.

Any help would be appreciated!
