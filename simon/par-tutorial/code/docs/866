This is well-worn folklore, but a bit misleading.  Most of my recent space leaks have been caused by excessive strictness.

Space leaks occur in all kinds of programs and languages, and I am not convinced there is a strong correlation between laziness and leakiness.  If anything, I think there is observation bias: lazy programmers have good tools for identifying, finding, and removing leaks.  Others do not.
