This announcement made me motivated to finally have a closer look at
LP.  Thanks for a rather excellent tool :)

There were some things that I bumped into though:

1. What to call files?  I understand (C)WEB suggests using .w, and
that noweb uses .nw, what should I call anansi files?
2. Combining anansi and pandoc works quite well for HTML, but it fails
miserably when trying to use the generated LaTeX:

    > markdown2pdf: ! LaTeX Error: Command \guillemotleft unavailable
in encoding OT1.

    Is there any good way to get around that?
3. Is there any editor support for anansi, syntax highlihgting etc?
