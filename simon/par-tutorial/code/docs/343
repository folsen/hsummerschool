I have often wished that there was a much bigger API for interacting 
with the RTS. Currently, you can query how many capabilities there are, 
and you can request a (magor?) GC cycle. And that's *it*.

One can imagine a far richer API, with the ability to do things like set 
and query RTS flags, query the GHC version number and RTS "way", ask how 
much RAM is allocated to what, request a minor or magor GC, try to 
release RAM to the OS, pre-allocate RAM from the OS because you're about 
to use it, find out how many threads are running or how many sparks are 
queued, and so on.

Of course, I doubt anyone is going to implement it anytime soon...
