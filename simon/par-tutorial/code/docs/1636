That's not the path to the directory from which the script is invoked 
(aka, $PWD or, more accurately, the results of `pwd`). That's the path 
to the directory containing the script.

The current working directory (the dir from which the program is 
invoked, provided the program haven't moved since invocation) can be 
gotten by System.Directory.getCurrentDirectory in the directory package.

Getting the path to the location of the executable is trickier business.
