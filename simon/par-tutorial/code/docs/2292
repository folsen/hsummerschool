Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Convert Double to Data.Fixed
Message-ID: <CANVKUrUzudNo9dp_H0c086Dv+oSY7fTfN=SCbz8Z=YqOmtC9eA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi cafe,

How do I most efficiently convert a Double to a Data.Fixed?

I'm asking because I want to convert fractional seconds to the seconds
field of Data.Time.TimeOfDay, which is Pico = Data.Fixed.Fixed E12.

For now the fastest thing I came up with was fromIntegral (round
(sec*1000000)) / fromIntegral 1000000, but this frankly sucks and is rather
slow, there must be a better way.
