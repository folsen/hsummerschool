I usually use .anansi, but it doesn't matter. You can use whatever
extensions you like, or even none at all.

The LaTeX loom is designed to output basic markup that can be turned
into a PDF with minimum fuss. It probably won't work as-is for more
advanced cases, such as when a user wants to use custom templates, or
has to inter-operate with pseudo-LaTeX parsers like Pandoc.

You could try copying the LaTeX loom into your own code, modifying it
to generate the custom output format you want, and then running it as
a #!runhaskell script.

Not that I know of. Note that Anansi's syntax itself is very minimal,
so what you need is an editor that can support formatting a file using
multiple syntaxes. I don't know enough about editor modification to
figure out which editors support such a feature, or how to enable it.
