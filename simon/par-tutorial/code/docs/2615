Yes, you're just building a tower of additions, and when evaluating
this, you blow up the stack.  You need to make sure to evaluate the
tuple element each time, so instead of 

>    case ys of  'A'  -> (elf, els+1,elr,ell,elx) 

write:

>    case ys of  'A'  -> els `seq` (elf, els+1,elr,ell,elx)

(Strictly speaking this will only evaluate the previous value, but your
 tower of additions will now have maximum one floor)
