I had dismissed GTK  - I assumed getting it set up in Windows would be a 
bit painful, and figured I'd stick with whats in the Haskell Platform 
for the moment. I'm already familiar (though very rusty) with Win32 from 
C - it seemed like an easy if limited option.

But I'll take a look at gtk2hs anyway.

Thanks.
