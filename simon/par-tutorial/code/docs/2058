Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Announce: The Haskell Platform 2011.4
Message-ID: <CAFd+Dr3kaJorXBEqcSFfjES0JtOJ5eEOeZ3-bJSAAwj-1LFpdw@mail.gmail.com>

We're pleased to announce the release of the Haskell Platform: a
single, standard Haskell distribution for everyone.

Download the Haskell Platform 2011.4.0.0:

    http://haskell.org/platform/

The specification, along with installers (including Windows, Apple and
Unix installers for a full Haskell environment) are available.

The Haskell Platform is a single, standard Haskell distribution for
every system, in the form of a blessed library and tool suite for
Haskell distilled from the thousands of libraries on Hackage, along with
installers for a wide variety of systems. It saves developers work
picking and choosing the best Haskell libraries and tools to use for a
task.

When you install the Haskell Platform, you get the latest stable
compiler, an expanded set of core libraries, additional development
tools, and cabal-install ? so you can download anything else you need
from Hackage.

What you get is specified here:

    http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/contents.html

Thanks!

-- The Platform Infrastructure Team

P.S. Special thanks to Mark Lentczner for his excellent work on this release.
