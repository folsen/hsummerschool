I haven't come across unimodular matrices before, but according to the
definition on wikipedia it seems fairly straightforward to implement a naive
algorithm to decide it.

Also, have you considered trying IRC for these sorts of short questions? The
#haskell IRC channel on freenode is helpful and seems better suited to
asking questions like this, if you just want quick answers. There's a
shorter lag than a mailing list, and the IRC medium seems closer to the
kinds of things I've seen you ask.
