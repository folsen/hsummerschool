Subject: [Haskell-cafe] HaXml 1.13 -> 1.22 upgrade
Message-ID: <4EE448DF.9030400@orlitzky.com>

I'm trying to migrate one my programs from the old HaXml API to the new. 
Please, someone save me.

I'm currently stuck with this, which works in 1.13. All of the filters 
work on Content, so I make some from the root element with the 
"root_elem = CElem root" line.

   -- |Takes an XML String as an argument, and returns the
   -- status that was parsed from it. Should only be used
   -- on XML string where a <status> is a top-level element.
   parse_status :: String -> [Status]
   parse_status xml_data =
     catMaybes maybe_status
     where
       (Document _ _ root _) = xmlParse xml_file_name xml_data
       root_elem = CElem root
       status_element = (single_status root_elem)
       maybe_status = map status_from_content status_element

In the new API, xmlParse returns the root element with type (Element i) 
rather than just Element. And the Content constructor I have to use is 
(CElem (Element i) i), but I have no way to pass the correct 'i' to it.

I just want to parse a few elements from an XML file.
