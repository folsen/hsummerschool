Hi all. There's recently been some talk about distributed haskell, but what
I wish to see is interest from an experienced member of the Haskell
community in implementing Haskell components with SCA/Tuscany. Please see
this and consider it, it'd be great to be able to use Haskell in the same
project with Java/Scala.

Thanks.
