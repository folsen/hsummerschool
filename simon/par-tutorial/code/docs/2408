Locking makes this fail with an exception, I think. Not locking would
make this mis-behave.

And lets pretend I wrote the function that was in my head:

append fromFilePath toFilePath = do
   str <- readFile fromFile
   appendFile toFile str

Here, without locking, I would expect to fill my disk up, whereas
previously my program would have crashed before writing out any data.

Maybe these are pathological examples, but they are (I think!) the
justification for having the locking in the first place.
