 when you compile the code it generates different object code...

Although it's possible, I doubt this would do anything. Most exploits
are just programmer mistakes; changing the object code doesn't change
the fact that there's a gaping security hole in your program. Plus, it
would be harder to debug the compiler, since the mangling code would
be non-deterministic by definition. So I doubt anyone would try to
implement that.
