Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Experimental 64 bit installer fails

I can confirm that Mark's Haskell 2011.2.0.0-x86_64 Mac OS X installer fix
works :)

cd /Library/Haskell/ghc-7.0.2/lib/registrations
for c in *.conf; do echo == $c ==; ghc-pkg register --force $c; done


My goal is to get Haskell ncurses working. c2hs is required, so I did:

$ cabal --version
cabal-install version 0.10.2
using version 1.10.1.0 of the Cabal library

$ cabal install c2hs
$ c2hs
-bash: c2hs: command not found

It appears Cabal never added ~/Library/Haskell/ghc-7.0.2/lib/c2hs-0.16.3/bin
to PATH. It's easy enough for me personally to fix, but Haskell 2010 didn't
have this problem.

Cheers,
