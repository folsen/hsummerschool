Different package.conf.d

I suggested obliterating C:\Documents and Settings\abailly\Application 
Data\ghc\i386-mingw32-7.0.3\package.conf.d (on linux it would be called 
~/.ghc/i386-linux-7.0.3/package.conf.d). That would just drop user 
packages and not touch boot packages (global packages for that matter).

You can also see that under the listing of D:/Program Files/Haskell 
Platform/2011.2.0.1\lib\package.conf.d the majority of packages are 
still there, not obliterated. (For example base, bin-package-db are 
still there.)
