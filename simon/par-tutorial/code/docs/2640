./Main 200 200 5900

after this, the program should start listening to port 5900

You can check if things are fine by telneting to localhost:5900, you should
see this -

ck at ck-desktop:~/lab/Chitra$ telnet localhost 5900
Trying ::1...
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
RFB 003.003

After this, you can use vncviewer to connect to localhost (5900 is the
default port for vnc)

Thanks Christian ... I've incorporated this.
