Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Dynamic loading of module
Message-ID: <CAL4zPao2eYnWWf1KL-sJ3NrVNw6Ar+eHVgnsDr7KSCikE_TZ4w@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I stumbled upon this blog post describing a method from dynamically loading
modules using GHC api.

While trying to test the given method, I got the following error which
obviously tells me my packages are not correctly installed but I have no
idea how to fix this.

D:\projets\>ghc -package ghc main.hs --make
<command line>: cannot satisfy -package ghc:
    ghc-7.0.3-fc75cf67c86ba2c0d64b07024a18d3b4 is unusable due to missing or
recursive dependencies:
      template-haskell-2.5.0.0-7d9b1443ac5ab69e5ed705a487990deb
    (use -v for more information)

When I run ghc-pkg check, I got which obviously is bad.
