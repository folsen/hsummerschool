Greetings,

I am very pleased to officially announce HacPhi 2011, a Haskell  
hackathon/get-together to be held July 29-31 at the University of  
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia supported by contributions from Amgen,  
Jane Street, and Microsoft Research.  The hackathon will officially  
kick off at 2:30 Friday afternoon, and go until 5pm on Sunday (with  
breaks for sleep, of course).  Last year's HacPhi was a lot of fun,  
drawing an international crowd, and many people have already expressed  
interest in coming back this year.  Come meet your Haskelly  
brothers-in-arms!  I want to stress that everyone is welcome---you do  
not have to be a Haskell guru.  Helping hack on someone else's project  
could be a great way to increase your Haskell-fu.

If you plan on coming, please officially register [1].  Registration,  
travel, lodging and many other details can be found on the HacPhi wiki  
[2].

We're also looking for a few people interested in giving short (15-20  
min.) talks, probably on Saturday afternoon.  Anything of interest to  
the Haskell community is fair game---a project you've been working on,  
a paper, a quick tutorial.  If you'd like to give a talk, add it on  
the wiki [3].

Hope to see you in Philadelphia!
