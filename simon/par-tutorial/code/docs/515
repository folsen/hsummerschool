Subject: [Haskell-cafe] errors while installing yesod 0.8
Message-ID: <BANLkTinnbgfJFA8pFptB9QwOSr3soP4DaQ@mail.gmail.com>

Trying to install yesod 0.8 breaks when it's time to install
monad-control. Google wasn't very helpful, nor was the error message I
received



mlitchard at apotheosis:~/monad-control$ cabal install
Resolving dependencies...
Configuring monad-control-0.2.0.1...
cabal: Error: some packages failed to install:
monad-control-0.2.0.1 failed during the configure step. The exception was:
ExitFailure 11


note: I've been trying to use the cab command to manage my packages, I
get the same error as above when I use cab instead of cabal.I mention
this just in case there is some unforseen problem having to do with
cab/cabal interaction.

Has anyone experienced this problem, or know what I can do to get more
useful error messages that might reveal the cause of the breakage?
