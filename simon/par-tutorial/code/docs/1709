Subject: [Haskell-cafe] How did iteratees get their names?
Message-ID: <CACruqwTG3fOEbwiTMohwTG8Mt-9HR=r+gHKu5BVLg0MT_JnTrQ@mail.gmail.com>

I love iteratees as a paradigm for IO, but I am having trouble developing a
relationship with the names. Could someone explain their origin?

It seems like if iteratees consume things, enumerators produce them,
andenumeratees do both that names like Sink, Source, and Transformer
or
Consumer, Producer, and Transformer might be more relatable choices? Is
there some reason apart from convention why these names wouldn't fit the
concepts well?
