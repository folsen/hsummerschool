Of course getAnIntFromUser is not a function. It is an instruction to  
computer.

Think of IO as a form of writing instructions to some worker (essentially,  
the kernel, which in its turn uses processor's io ports). You are asking  
this ?worker? to change some global state.

Thus, your function ?f? is a function indeed, which generates a list of  
instructions to kernel, according to given number.
