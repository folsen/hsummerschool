In the event that my comments on the previous thread were a source of 
confusion, I agree with the first and last sentences though the middle 
one is a bit more ambiguous.

Lawyers can argue about whether individual licenses as written (i.e., 
MIT, BSD3, GPL,...) have any interesting preorder (i.e., other than 
equality). But in practice distributors must adhere to sets of licenses, 
and these sets have the obvious lattice structure: namely Malcolm's last 
sentence. Again, whether this lattice has any interesting (i.e., 
non-free) equalities is best left up to lawyers.
