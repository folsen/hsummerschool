Subject: [Haskell-cafe] RFC: Extendable and Easy-To-Use Logger (HLogger)
Message-ID: <4DA48066.10805@jonkristensen.com>

Hello Haskellers!

I have developed a very simple logging library to be extendable and 
easy-to-use. You can see the current release at 
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hlogger/. The SimpleHLogger module is 
an example of what a HLogger implementation could look like. It could be 
used like this:

    import System.Log.SimpleHLogger

    main = do

       logger<- simpleLogger "test"

       loggerLog logger (Just ("LoggerTest", "main")) Debug "Test"

       loggerStop logger


As I have now implemented everything that I could think of, I would like 
to ask the Haskell community to give some feedback on HLogger so that I 
can continuing improving it. Some questions:

   1. Do you have any general/architectural thoughts on things I might
      be doing wrong?
   2. Is the ease-of-use goal contradicting making this library useful
      in more complex applications?
   3. Do I want to redesign HLogger to allow loggers to have a mutable
      state, and if so, how can I do that?
   4. Is there a nice way to provide the module and the function than
      using (Just ("LoggerTest, "main)) (shortening it somehow, I guess)?


Thanks!

Warm regards,
Jon Kristensen
