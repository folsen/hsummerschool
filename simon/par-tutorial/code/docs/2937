Subject: [Haskell-cafe]  Proving correctness
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=n4KhFcjcKFjn-K5iwW+GOW+rV3r0VMcGzL6aA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Folks,

I've come across this a few times - "In Haskell, once can prove the
correctness of the code" - Is this true?

I know that static typing and strong typing of Haskell eliminate a whole
class of problems - is that related to the proving correctness?
Is it about Quickcheck - if so, how is it different from having test sutites
in projects using mainstream languages?


Regards,
Kashyap
