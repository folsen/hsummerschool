If you have a Handle (from file or Network for example),

import System.IO(hGetContents, hSetEncoding, mkTextEncoding)
import Text.XML.HXT.Core

do e <- mkTextEncoding "WINDOWS-1251"
    -- or "CP1251" depending on OS
    hSetEncoding your'handle e
    s <- hGetContents your'handle
    t <- runX (readString [...] s >>> ...)
    ...

If you don't have a Handle but a ByteString (from Network.HTTP for 
example), dump it into a file first, then use the above.
