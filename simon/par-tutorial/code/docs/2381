I would suggest that advisory locking isn't particularly useful. I 
gather that Linux does now support real locking though. (And file update 
notifications, and ACLs, and lots of other things that Windows has had 
for far longer.)

Either way, I have no interest in starting a Windows vs Linux flamewar. 
I'm just saying it would be nice if Haskell could support more of what 
these two OSes have to offer.
