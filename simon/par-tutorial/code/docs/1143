Hi,

the actor package seems unmaintained and probably doesn't fit your needs. If
you want to implement some kind of publish/subscribe system over the
network, I'd suggest you take a look at ZeroMQ[1] and AMQP[2].
AMQP is probably easier to get started with, but it requires you to set up a
dedicated broker, which (if you have very high throughput) might become a
bottleneck. ZeroMQ, on the other hand, allows for a more decentralized
architecture.

Regards,
Holger
