Probably not EBCDIC. :-)

Correct me if I'm wrong here, but I think nobody has compelling
reasons for using any other Unicode format than UTF-8.  Although some
systems use UTF-16 (or some approximation thereof) internally, UTF-8
seems to be the universal choice external encoding.  However, there
probably exists a bit of code using Latin-1 and Windows charsets, and
here leading characters aren't going to help you all that much.

I think the safest thing to do is to require source to be ASCII, and
provide escapes for code points >127...
