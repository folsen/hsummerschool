Hi. I am Awesome WM user thinking about swithcing to the xmonad. Could I
take an opportunity and ask about mouse support in xmonad/xmobar ?
Actually, I assume that xmobar does nothing with mouse, but what is a
common way of showing something like main menu to the user? Is there an
option of switching windows with mouse by pressing on some window's icon,
just like common DE does?

Thanks,
Sergey.
