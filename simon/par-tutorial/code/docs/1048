The output I didn't like wasn't coming from HUnit, it was coming from
the test aggregator I used (test-framework). It prints one line per
test case run, whether it passed or failed.

That means every time I ran my test suite, it would print *thousands*
of lines to the terminal. Any failure immediately scrolled up and out
of sight, so I'd have to either Ctrl-C and hunt it down, or wait for
the final report when all the tests had finished running.

Chell does the same thing as test-framework (aggregates tests into
suites, runs them, reports results), but does so quietly. It only
reports failed and aborted tests.
