Hi Navin,

next time, could you please choose more informative subject for your
emails to the mailing list? It is read by many people, and choosing a
good subject will save them a lot of time. In this case, something like
"Stack overflow" or "How to make a function strict" would do.

Thanks.

Don't worry what people think, they don't do it very often.
