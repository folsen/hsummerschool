Moreover, afaict, the "Awkward Squad" operational semantics tackles only a
tiny fraction of the IO type.

One of the strengths of Haskell IO is that it can be extended easily via
the FFI. And I guess that strength is also a theoretical weakness in the
sense that only a tiny fraction of the IO interface has even an operational
semantics.
