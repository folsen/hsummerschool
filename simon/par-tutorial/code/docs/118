If by "insist", you mean the standard insist that implementations support
UTF-8 by default.

The rest of the standard already just talks about sequences of unicode
characters, so I don't see much to be gained by prohibiting other encodings.

In particular, I have read that systems set up for east asian scripts
often use UTF-16 as a default encoding.
