Yes! This is a great idea.

I'm a Haskell enthusiast in St. Louis, MO, USA and have given numerous
talks on Haskell locally at Lambda Lounge[1], a catch-all groups for
functional programmers, and the St.Louis Perl Mongers[2].

I would love to have a dedicated Haskell User Group, but unfortunately
this town appears to run on the JVM and I haven't been able to drum up
too much interest by myself. I've also never started or run a user
group before and I am also not the greatest salesman so some pointers
on how to create a buzz would be helpful.
