AFAICT, this is incorrect and should be something like

    ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libstdc++.so.6 /usr/lib/libstdc++.so

(where x86_64-linux-gnu depends on your platform).

Normally this isn't a problem since to above-mentioned directory is in 
ld.so.conf, but that (apparently) isn't handled correctly by GHC.

A less permanent workaround is to just add

    /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu

to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH in your environment before running anything GHC 
related.

Many distros have started to *not* install a /usr/lib/libstdc++.so 
symlink (nor even any /usr/lib/libstdc++*.so files at all) in /usr/lib,
preferring to use the above-mentioned directory instead and listing it 
in /etc/ld.so.conf.

It has something to do with getting saner multilib (and multiarch?) support.
