It's hard to help because I still don't know what problem you're having.
 The error code from the attempted GLFW install is not included in your
abbreviated log.  As I recommended before try this command:
cabal install GLFW-0.4.2

That will attempt only the GLFW install which will mean less output to look
through for the error message.
