Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Cabal-1.10.1.0 and bytestring-0.9.2.0 hackage
	problem.
Message-ID: <20110825144258.GC2485@24f89f8c-e6a1-4e75-85ee-bb8a3743bb9f>

Dear list,

Cabal-1.10.1.0 contains a bug that causes it to fail to parse the
test-suite target of bytestring-0.9.2.0. Since cabal-install parses
all package descriptions to before resolving dependencies, users
with that version of Cabal are stuck.

Now it seems somebody realised this problem and removed
bytestring-0.9.2.0 from hackage. However,

1. http://hackage.haskell.org/package/bytestring is now broken.
2. The downloadeble package index (00-index.tar) still contains
   the bytestring-0.9.2.0 cabal file, so the problem persists.

As a workaround, one can remove the cabal file from the downloaded
index manually,

tar -f ~/.cabal/packages/hackage.haskell.org/00-index.tar --delete bytestring/0.9.2.0

(or rebuild Cabal / cabal-install starting with
'cabal unpack Cabal; cabal unpack cabal-install')

But it really needs to be fixed on the hackage server.

Best regards,

Bertram
