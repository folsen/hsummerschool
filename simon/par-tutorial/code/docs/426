Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Cairo and Haskell
Message-ID: <io9imb$1n8$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hi,

I would like to use Haskell to generate automatically a poster.
I guess that would be using Cairo so I can have a 2d canvas to draw in 
and maybe even preview before exporting to PDF.

However, I can't find any documentation on Cairo with Haskell or any 
code examples related to what I want to do.

Any suggestions?

Cheers,
