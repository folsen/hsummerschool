Subject: [Haskell-cafe] If you'd design a Haskell-like language,
 what would you do different?
Message-ID: <1324322427.2233.6.camel@fuzxxl>

Image you would create your own language with a paradigm similar to
Haskell or have to chance to change Haskell without the need to keep any
compatibility. What stuff would you add to your language, what stuff
would you remove and what problems would you solve completely different?

Thanks in advance for all answers, yours
