Hi Hamish,

I am checking what is to be done to get this new release into Debian,
and I notice quite a few changes to the dependencies, including some
duplication of existing libraries (haddock-leksah, haddock-process).

That is something we would definitely like to avoid in Debian. Can you
tell us why exactly you need different packages, e.g. a link to the bug
report where you ask for inclusion of your changes? Ideally, we would in
Debian incorporate your changes in the Debian package of process or
haddock, but of course only if they are reviewed by upstream and will
eventually be merged.

Also, is there a chance that the features of binary-shared will be
merged into binary eventually?

Thanks,
Joachim
