New and Updated Projects

   These projects were announced in the mailing lists:

   * syntactic (Emil Axelsson): Update to version 0.5
     [3] http://goo.gl/sKutg

   * Yi (Jeff Wheeler): Update to version 0.6.4.0
     [4] http://goo.gl/Tr2Ns

Quotes of the Week

   * sipa: it can optimize non-terminating programs into programs that
     output "<<loop>>" and quit; that's an optimization of infinity% !

   * fazzone: People generally seem to react the same way to "My first
     assembly was x86" as "My dog died" -- "Oh my god, I'm so sorry"

   * [danharaj] I hate myself
     [edwardk] happy to help

   * bos: the number of people who grok rank-K types is inversely
     proportional to ackermann(K)

   * copumpkin: holy shit, I'm unsafeCoerce

   * quicksilver: edwardk had this brilliant idea of how he could
     stress-test our package architecture

   * chrisdone: monoid sounds like a name for a hairless alien species
     that communicates telepathically from star trek

   * [copumpkin] I basically translated repa to agda and made it all
     		 safe n shit. also all slow n shit
     [thoughtpolice] safe n shit,
     		     like, type systems yo

   * theorbtwo: Well, that's one way to respond to ghc having
     overly-long error messages. Just replace all error messges with
     "that's the stupidist shit I've ever heard".

   * acowley: I'm 101% sure I never would have figured it out. I was
     told all hope was lost, then simonmar swung in on his web shooters
     and figured it out

   * quicksilver: agda is an alluring trap for haskell programmers who
     hope to write better code. instead they end up writing no code.
