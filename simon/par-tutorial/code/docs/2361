Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Windows: openFile gives permission denied when file
	in use
Message-ID: <CAKA2JgLc1Q-Lf_yOuhQdb1JKuUkiRYuS=hQ7wQw_+jqCMQOEYQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I just received a bug report from a client that, when an input file is
open in FrameMaker, my program gives a "permission denied error". This
bug is reproducible with a simple Haskell program:

import System.IO

main = do
    putStrLn "here1"
    h <- openFile "filename.txt" ReadMode
    putStrLn "here2"

I tried writing a simple C program using fopen, and it ran just fine.
Does anyone have experience with this issue, and know of a workaround?

Thanks,
Michael
