Hi

I was running into a similar problem while working on GHC not long ago -
short version is that it's not even possible to find out the executable
path portably from C [1]. Using argv[0] just gave me the path of the GHC
wrapper script, for example - as it uses exec without "-a".

The whole thing is easiest if you're on Linux:

  getExePath = readSymbolicLink "/proc/self/exe"

On all other operation system, one needs to start mucking around with
custom kernel calls.

Or, more realistically, try to find a way around requiring it...

Greetings,
