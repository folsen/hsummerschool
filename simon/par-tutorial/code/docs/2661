And swap the arguments.



Thanks for going the extra mile.

No problem, just change the definition of the Heron type synonym and swap 
the applcations of runReader[T] and evalState[T] in mySqrt, the monadic 
sqrtH can remain unchanged :)

That's because only methods of the MonadState and the MonadReader class are 
used and instances of MonadState are propagated/lifted through ReaderT, 
instance of MonadReader are propagated/lifted through StateT.

(
instance MonadReader r m => MonadReader r (StateT s m) where
? ? ask = lift ask
? ? local = ...
instance MonadState s m => MonadState (ReaderT r m) where
? ? get = lift get
? ? put = ...
)

If you use a function on the inner monad which is not propagated to the 
entire transformer stack via class instances, you have to use lift (if you 
have a MonadTrans instance) or something similar.
