Thanks, I was able to get it working after a little sleep/coffee.

The migration guide says to replace all of the 'i' with () if you don't 
care about them, so I tried that, but it doesn't work in this case: the 
two 'i' in (CElem (Element i) i) have to match.

The only way I see to construct a Posn is with noPos, so I stuck that in 
there. It's probably not correct, but it compiles and runs, so it's 
correct =)
