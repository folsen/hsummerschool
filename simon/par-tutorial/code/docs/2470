Great question!  It suggests that the line between computation and its side effects is not as clear-cut as we (well, I) thought.

If computations are Platonistic, mathematico-logical "things", then is actual computation a side-effect of the Platonic Idea?  Heh heh.

Dunno, somebody else will have to answer that one.
