So-so. Probably the majority of users are still on ghc-6.*, for them, 0.8.2 
is the right choice. The page should have two links, one for ghc-6 and one 
for ghc-7, but I guess the Cabal cabal is too busy doing more important 
things (like writing code) to always think of updating the web-page.

Good.
Just a tip, generally, it's easier to get stuff from hackage,
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-install
in this case.
You can see the dependencies listed there, and see what version fits best 
with what you have. If something depends on an older version of a library 
than you have, that's a bad sign. If something depends on a newer version 
of time, process, directory, random (a couple of others, basically what ghc 
itself was built with), that's a bad sign too.
When in doubt,
$ cabal install whatever --dry-run
If that says it would install a library you already have, be careful, that 
may introduce the dreaded diamond dependency problem.
