[Moving to haskell-cafe, not really library specific any more]

the observation is correct, but unfortunately hard to change ? Debian is
large, slow moving, and unlikely to change policies for a corner-case
such as Haskell libraries. 

Also, the policies that make life a bit more harder for us are also the
policies that make Debian a good distribution: E.g. manually creating a
copyright file describing who all has copyright on the files, and what
license the files are under ? .cabal has fields for that, but
unfortunately, they very often do not reflect the reality of the .hs
files. Or the other one, requiring that an upload of a source package is
accompanied by a manually built and signed binary package ensures that
the maintainer actually checked that the package builds and hopefully
has tested it.

If you think more about it, the lack of some of the policies on Hackage,
e.g. nobody checking that licenses and copyright are correctly specified
and actually compatible with dependencies, make Hackage a dangerous
source for serious users. I am not saying that this should change, but
the cheapness of Hackage uploads has its downsides.

Greetings,
Joachim
