Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Problems creating Haskell-dll without -fvia-C
Message-ID: <1314617512681-4745874.post@n5.nabble.com>

Hi! 

I recently read a haskell-cafe-thread telling me that the compiler option
-fvia-C 
will be removed. This gets me a bit worried... 

I use -fvia-C when I build my haskell dll, and it works just fine (Haskell
2010.2.0.0): 

ghc -c Adder.hs -O2 -fvia-C 
ghc -c StartEnd.c 
ghc -shared -o Adder.dll Adder.o Adder_stub.o StartEnd.o Adder.def 
  
Next I create a lib which can be imported in Visual C++: 

lib /machine:i386 /def:SingThing.def 


BUT...if I remove the flag -fvia-C, the program crashes when I run it:( 


I've tried experimenting with a few things: 

*  Haskell FFI's calling conventions ccall/stdcall 

*  Skipping the .def file 

*  Skipping "lib /machine:i386 /def:SingThing.def", instead trying the
approach descibed in: 

http://blogs.msdn.com/b/satnam_singh/archive/2011/04/19/creating-a-windows-dll-from-a-haskell-program-and-calling-it-from-c.aspx
  

Can anyone please give me a hint of whats going on? 

I guess it must be somthing with pointers and calling conventions, but I'm
banging my head against the wall now:( 

Cheers Klas 

(Btw... I should mention that the simple Adder.hs example actually works
without -fvia-C, my 
 dll is more advanced, but I'm following the same compiling procedure)
