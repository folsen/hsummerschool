Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANN: ekg-0.2 - Remote monitoring of processes
Message-ID: <CAK-tuPYtHhitwA8UEAu4j+hNh1dW08XchOw2vPBhtUssWyEukA@mail.gmail.com>

(I forgot to announce v0.1 so this is a combined announcement.)

I'm proud to announce the ekg [1] library. The library lets you remotely
monitor any running Haskell program, using your web browser or an automated
monitoring program.

The library lets you monitor garbage collector and memory usage statistics
(similar to what's provided by +RTS -s, but live), but also lets you
defined your own counters that you can update from within your program.

For some more examples see:
