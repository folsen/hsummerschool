You can simulate that with a type class.  The "no instance" error
substitutes for the "term".

class Hole obj where hole :: obj

foo :: Blah
foo x y z = hole

"No instance for type Blah"

Presumably, you wouldn't want to make instances.  I use a similar construct
for monic and epic functions, since the natural ones tend to be unique
enough.
