I dunno, I found the quote interesting. I had typed up a scornful
response to the effect that everyone knows it's a Dijkstra quote and
he could find sourcing in seconds with Google, but as the seconds
passed, I had to rewrite the seconds bit, then as I found actual
cites, I had to rewrite the Dijkstra bit, and then I realized that
replying to that email might take a while...
