Hi Yitz,

Thanks, but I don't really need a functional server or anything; I just want
to have a local copy of Hackage on disk (latest versions only will do) and
tell cabal-install to use that instead of the web.

Regarding yackage, I don't think I can open ports on that machine either...


Thanks,
Pedro
