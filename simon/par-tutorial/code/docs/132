Subject: [Haskell-cafe] lhs2tex and comment
Message-ID: <BANLkTikK9bLHqxCXqYF_jboPLDY2FS0VGQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi!

I have problems with lhs2tex and nested (long) comments. It formats it
all in one long line and does not wrap it. Is there a way to define
those comments so that it would maybe automatically wrap them at the
end of the page? (And still take into the account possible indentation
of comments.) Or at least to not ignore newlines in comments?

I am using poly mode.
