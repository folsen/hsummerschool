Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Trouble with readProcess
Message-ID: <CAB6QvNMibG0QCKKtT0cOixDB0YqJBNsJQyGzHi0CB4u6LJrm+g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi -cafe,

I'm using readProcess and I don't know how to handle this issue:

readProcess cmd [opt1,opt2] seems to execute the following:
$ cmd "opt1" "opt2"

That is usually fine, but I'm using an external program that doesn't
understand the quotes, so I need to execute instead:
$ cmd opt1 opt2

How should I do that?
