I'd suggest, in addition to the symbols, renaming some of the fundamental types and concepts, like Monad. I would violently agree that Monad is the correct term, but try to communicate with a commodity software developer sometime (or a government acquisition professional). RWH goes a long way to explaining the concepts, as do the countless Web pages dedicated to explaining the monad concept. 

Better examples for SYB and arrows would also help. 

Haskell is a great language with solid mathematical underpinnings. I'm a big fan of it. But, adoption is the key to success; need to make the ordinary easy to understand unless the community wants to be relegated to Scala status.

Now we just need ? to replace \, ? to replace ->, and ? to replace /=
(which still looks like division assignment no matter how hard I squint
my eyes. 25 years of C and C derived languages is hard to forget).

Hey, forget replacing, wouldn't it be wonderful if the compiler would
just accept them as synonyms?
