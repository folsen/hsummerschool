Hi Ivan, sorry for late, too busy on Linux job.

Yes, i have got hot-swap code work for Manatee
(http://hackage.haskell.org/package/manatee)

I used to use plugins, but i found it's buggy.
So i use GHC-API wrote my own code at:
https://patch-tag.com/r/AndyStewart/manatee-core/snapshot/current/content/pretty/Manatee/Core/Dynload.hs

Michael, from your need, you just need read function `dynload`, other
functions is write for Manatee framework.

Let me explain function `dynload`:

    dynload :: (String, String, [(String, HValue -> IO ())]) -> IO ()
    dynload (filepath, moduleName, loadList) = ...

First argument is FilePath that contain module.
Second argument is moduleName you need scan.
Third argument is tuple list that contain symbol you need load and
callback function for symbol's HValue.

Once function `dynload` find symbol in target module, it will use below code
dynamic load new value:

    (do
        hValue <- compileExpr (moduleName ++ "." ++ symbolName)
        liftIO $ loadFun hValue)

function `compileExpr` will get the HValue of symbol, then use loadFun
update HVaule in running program.

The key is `HValue -> IO ()`, you need build TVar/IORef in your
running program, once you got new HValue, you should write
writeTVar/writeIORef in function `HValue -> IO ()` to update the value of
TVar/IORef, then you can dynamic loading new value and don't need
reboot.

I have draw some picture to explain above framework:

Michael, hope above will help you, good luck! :)
