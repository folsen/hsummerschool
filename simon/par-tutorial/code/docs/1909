Maybe, but something like this is best fixed by improving
documentation, not by shuffling things around and needlessly breaking
APIs.  I also agree that if an Alternative instance doesn't make sense
it should be removed.   The current documentation is indeed very terse
indeed.  In particular it needs a section on the pitfalls that users
are likely to run into (like infinite loops).
