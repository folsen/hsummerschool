>> I'm not sure I can make sense of what you mean here. Given the preamble, I'd guess you're asking whether we should make x86_64 the targeted architecture for OSX support, and reclassify 32-bit OSX to unsupported or "hopefully it still works" status. (But in that case, it's the 32-bit which would be "relegated" to unsupported status while x86_64 is "considered a supported platform"...)

Yes.  I'm saying that I believe that OSX x86_64 should be the officially supported platform instead of 32-bit x86 with all the associated guarantees and assurances.   I wanted to see how people felt about that.
