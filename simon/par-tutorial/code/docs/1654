Hello Haskell Cafe,

I would be grateful for any information regarding Haskell (or at least 
Functional Programming) lectures at Universities near to Munich, Germany 
(Master or Bachelor). Unconfirmed information I've got regarding LMU and TUM 
are not promising.
If Munich and 200 km circle do not provide with any offer, perhaps you may know 
what is available in Europe, limiting language of study to [German, English, 
Polish]?

Best regards,
Bartek
