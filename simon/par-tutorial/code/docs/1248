OK, so you want my other suggestion (Data.Fixed).  I don't know how
difficult it would be to add support into HDBC, or how many problems you'll
run into using it because other functions you might need are too specialized
(that is, you'd need to marshal to/from Rational anyway, or write your own
Fixed implementations).  I found it a bit painful last time I used it, but
the GHC ecosystem has evolved considerably since then (I was using GHC 6.6).
 At least it now has more than just Nano and Pico precisions predefined....
