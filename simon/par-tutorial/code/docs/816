The main reason other VCSes have two concepts is because one of them is often more efficiently implemented (internally) than the other.  But that's silly - how much better to abstract over the mental clutter, and let the implementation decide how its internals look!

There's also the fact that using in-repo branches means that all the 
tooling doesn't have to rely on any (fs-specific) conventions for 
finding branches.

As someone who has admin'd a reasonably large Bazaar setup (where branch 
== directory similarly to Darcs) I can honestly say that this would be a 
HUGE boon.
