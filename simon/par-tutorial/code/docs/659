Dependancy on haddock-leksah only applies if you are using ghc-6.10.
If you are only supporting ghc 6.12 and above you can ignore it.

This is what is in the leksah-server.cabal file...
   if (impl(ghc >= 6.12))
      build-depends: haddock >= 2.7.2 && <2.10
   else
      build-depends: haddock-leksah == 2.5.0

process-leksah is still needed.  The feature request is here...
 http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3994
Favonia has recently made some suggestions and raised some concerns
and I imagine it may take a little while to resolve those.

Once it is in we will need to update some of the imports as
process-leksah module names are different to avoid conflicts.

We would like to see it included and we will prepare a patch and submit
it to trac/ghc for consideration.

Thanks,
Hamish
