Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Why not Darcs?
Message-ID: <4DB093A6.8000303@btinternet.com>

I'm sure this must be a VFAQ, but... There seems to be universal 
agreement that Darcs is a nice idea, but is unsuitable for "real" 
projects. Even GHC keeps talking about getting rid of Darcs. Can anybody 
tell me what the "problems" with Darcs actually are?
