I apologize if I'm missing something obvious here, but when I try to
run taffybar I get

Launching custom binary /home/alex/.cache/taffybar/taffybar-linux-i386

taffybar-linux-i386: ConnectionError "connectSession:
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS is missing or invalid."

Is there some D-BUS configuration that needs to happen before the
package is usable?

Thanks,
Alex
