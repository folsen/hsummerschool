Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Haskell on-line judge for Programming Challenges /
	Contests ?
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=aork0NzPnxAX+AEoidpxRVH31YA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
I am looking for a site providing on-line automatic judge for Programming
Challenges that can be coded in Haskell.
For example this site:
http://www.programming-challenges.com
provides lots of interesting programming provlems:
http://www.programming-challenges.com/pg.php?page=index

Yet, unfortunately only C, C++ and Java code can be submitted,  judge on
that site can't compile and run Haskell code.
Is there any similar online judge for Haskell?

Thanks,
Dmitri
