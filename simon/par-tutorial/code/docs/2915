Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ghci command line execution
Message-ID: <F7C8D201-FD5B-4386-B858-8B64DFA0FA5C@gmail.com>

A while ago I remember someone showing me some tool, I *think* ghci that allowed you to pass it a function of type String -> String as an input, and have it simply run that function on stdin (presumably using interact) to achieve useful things like this...

$ cat myFile.txt | ghci -e 'unlines . zipWith (\x y -> show x ++ " " ++ y) [1..] . lines'

Does anyone know what it was that I saw being used here?

Thanks
