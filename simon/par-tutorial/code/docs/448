Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Cairo and Haskell
Message-ID: <1302977643.2050.53.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Hello Paulo,

<< I guess that would be using Cairo so I can have a 2d canvas to draw
in and maybe even preview before exporting to PDF. However, I can't find
any documentation on Cairo with Haskell or any code examples related to
what I want to do. >>

With regard to export to pdf and other formats this might be useful:
http://muitovar.com/gtk2hs/app1.html (There's a Spanish translation
too.) However, this tutorial is a few years old now, and I don't know if
it's still up to date for the later Gtk2Hs versions.

Best Regards,

Hans van Thiel
