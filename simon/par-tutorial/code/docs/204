Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Local copy of hackageDB
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=dXeg+movZswKiaTavDNaJxhHOuQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I want to use cabal-install on a machine without internet access. I tried
downloading http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/archive.tar,
unpacking it and setting the local-repo field in the config file to this
location but that doesn't work, as cabal-install says that it is missing the
package list for the local repo. What should I do?


Thanks,
Pedro
