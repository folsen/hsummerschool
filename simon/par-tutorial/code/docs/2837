Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Building Plaftorm 2010 2 on 64bit Linux
Message-ID: <4D511D52.90503@fit.vutbr.cz>

Hello all,

   I'm trying to build platform on Linux 2.6.32.22 #1 SMP Tue Sep 21 
09:44:04 CEST 2010 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux. I've downloaded 
binary of ghc6.12.3 for the purpose, but ghc doesn't work. ghci does 
work, gcc does work, but for ghc I get:

ghc -O2 --make test.hs -o test
[1 of 1] Compiling Main             ( test.hs, test.o )
ghc: could not execute: /usr/bin/gcc

Even if I can easily compile gcc testc.c -o testc and run testc.

Could anyone point me to a solution? Helps found by google pointed me to 
try use option -pgmc gcc, which doesn't work. All other threads with 
similar issue stayed unresoleved. :-(

Thanks

    Dusan
