Your MathExpression data type has nothing to do with numbers of any kind. Your "Float" data constructor doesn't mean that float numbers are a part of your type; instead it means that you have a SINGLE value of type MathExpression, and this value is named "Float".

You should modify your data declaration as "data MathExpression = Float Float | ?", and after that you can write something like "a = Float 4.2", which would automatically make "a" a value of type MathExpession".
