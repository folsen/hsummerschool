Message-ID: <4EE16A89.90102@galois.com>

Hi Everyone,

I'm pleased to announce the release of cereal version 0.3.5.0!  New to 
this release is support for default, generic implementations of the get 
and put methods of the Serialize class, when support is available.  This 
functionality comes to you courtesy of Bas van Dijk.

Happy Hacking!
