Subject: [Haskell-cafe] cabal install --hyperlink-source ?
Message-ID: <4ED8F93A.1070001@imn.htwk-leipzig.de>

Hello.

I can do "cabal install --enable-documentation"
which is nice because it does
configure, build, haddock and copy in one go,

but I don't see how to pass options
from "cabal install" to  "cabal haddock" (e.g., --hyperlink-source)

Any hints appreciated, J.W.
