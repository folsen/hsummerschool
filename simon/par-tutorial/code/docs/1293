If you need any help with the tutorial, I might be able to help.  *Beginning
Scala* is reputed to be approachable by a broad range of developers and I'd
be happy to try to apply my approach in *Beginning Scala* to Haskell
(although, I stand in slack-jawed awe of both *Learn you a Haskell* and *Real
World Haskell* which are both amazing works.)
