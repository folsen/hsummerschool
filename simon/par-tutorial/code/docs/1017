Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Potential problem with AC-Vector-Fancy package
Message-ID: <CALaNiFmSjO5yZqe0vOaiXWX4Rc-AaQvYxE7QBZQcbvRXYcGw3g@mail.gmail.com>

Is anyone maintaining the AC-Vector-Fancy package?
I haven't had a reply from the latest maintainer (Andrew Coppin) on Hackage,
so I thought I'd open it up to cafe:

I think I have found a problem with the union function:
If you look here: http://hpaste.org/49889
You will see that line 4 gives a different result to lines 6, 8, 10; this
shouldn't be the case because union is commutative.
