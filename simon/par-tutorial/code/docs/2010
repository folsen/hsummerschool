Hi, 

I can't remember if it was threadscope that crashed or the RTS, since I was also having segfaults in the RTS because of this bug, that is fixed in 7.2.2: http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/5552

I successfully used threadscope by running my code for fewer iterations to produce a smaller log, and it was helpful to make sure I was dividing work equally between the threads.

I think I still have the log file that was about 1.8GB so I will try running threadscope on it and see what happens.

The performance problems I was having turned out to be fixed completely by changing the GC options passed to the RTS.

thanks!

Tom
