Answering to Mike Meyer here, because it has been requested multiple
times that we move the discussion to the cafe.

What you described about Eiffel didn't sound very different from what
Haskell does, but in Haskell the OOP part is missing.  You can very well
pass MVars as arguments to a concurrent thread.  This is the usual way
to tell a thread to do something and wait for its answer.  Of course you
don't have to wait right away.  You can command multiple threads to do
something and then collect the answers pretty straightforwardly both
with little programming and with little execution overhead.

However, as STM gains more popularity you generally don't use the old
fashioned command/wait concept.  You would rather have a certain number
of threads running all the time and communicating through transactions
in variables.  Threads with shorter lifetimes (for example for client
connections) would not know about the other threads.  They just know
about the variables they need to use.
