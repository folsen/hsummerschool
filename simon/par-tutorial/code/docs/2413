Why would  IO Int  be something special or mysterious? It's an ordinary 
value like everything else; it's on the same footing as [Char], Maybe 
Int, Int -> String, Bool, and so on. I see no difference between the 
list  [1,2,3] :: [Int]  and the action  "pick a random number between 1 
and 6" :: IO Int  .
