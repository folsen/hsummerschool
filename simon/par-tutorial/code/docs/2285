I kindly beg to differ. To me concurrency and parallelism have global and
cross-language definitions.
The links you gave don't only define "concurrency" and "parallelism" in
absolute as they focus their definition around Erlang's and Haskell's *models
*of concurrency/parallelism. Still the broad idea remains.

Haskell-specific.

My referencial was Haskell-centric. And we can go by steps: first come to a
consensus within the Haskellers and then give broad definitions that
concerne every language.
