Using Data.Dynamic, Haskell has a story for laziness at the type level, too.

Haskell has:
value-level lazy, can opt-out
type-level lazy, can opt-in
continuations, can opt-in

Python has:
value-level eager, no choice
type-level lazy, no choice
no continuations, no choice

If Python type laziness were that great, why isn't it rich in type-level 
programs? Has anyone even added numbers in Python at the type level?
