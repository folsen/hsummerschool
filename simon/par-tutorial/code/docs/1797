(in short:  yes, it's broken, and probably not fixable.  cabal is a
friendlyish wrapper for ghc-pkg, which is not a package manager in the
sense many people want it to be, and it never will be.)

Something *really* needs to be done about its absurd willingness to blindly
override bootlibs and thereby break things, though.
