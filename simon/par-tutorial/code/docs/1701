I should really add as well that if you contribute patches that will
increase the likelyhood of this being added in the near future from
~0% to 100% :-)

In general I'd like to encourage anyone interesting in hacking on
small useful projects for the benefit of the Haskell community to take
a look at the Haddock trac. It's got a lot of nice little feature
requests that no one is working on.

In general we're not seeing that much new development in Haddock at
the moment. I am (as the maintainer) mostly spending my time fixing
bugs, making releases and so on. If anyone feels like helping out,
please talk to me.

David
