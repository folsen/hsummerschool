Next, please...

You know, this suggests that you should read the parable of Blind Men 
and the Elephant.

Alright, my turn. I never wanted to write non-terminating programs (what 
for?), and all my programs executed exactly those instructions they 
should have executed, not more or less. I see ONE usage of laziness: the 
possibility to write co-recursive equations, which become algorithms. 
The possibility to represent processes as "data", which makes it easier 
to reason upon them. Do we really need some dogmatic specification of 
laziness?...
