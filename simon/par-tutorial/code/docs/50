That looks wrong. ghc-7 comes with Cabal-1.10, so you should better build 
cabal-install with that, that would be cabal-install-0.10.
Which cabal-install package have you?

That's a weird constraint. Impossible to fulfill, >= 4 && < 3.

Try downloading and unpacking cabal-install-0.10.* and run the bootstrap 
script from that. If that doesn't work, report again.
