I saw this same article this morning. I personally am not so interested in
compiling Haskell to run as Javascript, though it definitely sounds like a
nice idea. I was wondering if we can somehow build Haskell/LLVM bytecode
bundles, similar to how Java code gets distributed as JARs. Imagine being
able to do any/all of these:

* Build a bundle from any package on Hackage.
* Have a utility that can convert this to Javascript via emscripten
* Create a Haskell runtime for different OSes that can run these bundles,
and comes complete with GTK/Qt and a few other basic libraries.
* Convert a bundle into something that can run natively on the JVM or CLR.
* Create a "Haskell Web Start" where Haskell bundles can be run with a
single click from the browser.

This is far from my area of expertise, but I know that I could put such a
system to good use. A lot of this stuff (running on JVM/CLR for instance)
already has a good head start from efforts in the LLVM world.
