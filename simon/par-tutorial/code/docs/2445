Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Level of Win32 GUI support in the Haskell platform
Message-ID: <4EFD1992.60702@blueyonder.co.uk>

I've been for functions like GetMessage, TranslateMessage and 
DispatchMessage in the Haskell Platform Win32 library - the usual 
message loop stuff - and not finding them. Hoogle says "no results found".

Is this level of Win32 GUI coding supported? (other than by dealing with 
the FFI myself)

Alternatively, should I be doing dialog-based coding and leaving Haskell 
to worry about message loops behind the scenes?

Either way, is there an example I can use for reference? I have 
something along the lines of Petzolds Hello World in mind as the ideal 
(register a window class, handle the messages, paint some text), but 
anything that shows how to get a basic Win32 GUI app running in Haskell 
is fine.
