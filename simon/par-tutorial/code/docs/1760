It looks like you already have 1) and 2) finished, using the 'time' package.

If you need to convert into a specific time-zone you can use the
'utcToLocalTime' function in the 'time' package, which takes a UTCTime
and a TimeZone to create a 'LocalTime'. I'm just guessing that you
might want this, as your output format doesn't include time-zone
information.

Then for formatting, the 'Data.Time.Format' module in the 'time'
package has the function 'formatTime', which uses the same sort of
format string used by 'parseTime'.

I hope that helps! It took me a while to find my way around the 'time'
package properly.
