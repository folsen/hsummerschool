While I appriciate the patch theory I don't think darcs fits the
workflow of at least some people

Assume following changes
1. Feature X - file x.hs
2. Feature Y - file y.hs and x.hs
3. Feature Z - file z.hs and x.hs
4. Fix to feature Y (changes x.hs)
5. Fix to feature X (changes x.hs)

Now before pushing I would like to have 3 nice commits. In git I can
rewrite history by single command:

# git rebase -i origin/master

and edit the file to look like

pick 1
fixup 5
pick 2
fixup 4
pick 3

Manually/automatically check everything is ok.
