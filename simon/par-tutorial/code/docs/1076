Well, the better option would be to try with the NCG, and also with LLVM
(the -fllvm flag).  While the NCG is certainly competitive for idiomatic
Haskell code, it's likely to be a bit behind when it comes to heavy
C-in-Haskell code like what often gets submitted to the shootout.  LLVM
seems likely to do better in some cases.
