Git is good enough for serious use.

If something goes wrong, the maintainer of c.h.o can commiserate with
you about it being down.
I suspect he/she doesn't have a large team of dedicated sysadmins to
put it right, or a set of redundant servers.

> 3) Maturity? I can put darcs repos there, how mature does it need to be?

integrated pull requests, commenting systems, notifications of
updates, issue trackers...

if you particularly want to use something else for each of these,
that's fine, but it's nice to have a reasonable default.
