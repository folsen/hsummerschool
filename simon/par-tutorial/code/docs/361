Jon, thanks for HLogger! For my (small) needs I was looking for a
simple logging solution, and I couldn't get HSLogger to do what I
wanted, whereas your simpleLogger fitted the bill perfectly.
I suppose a good thing would be conditional buffering, as other noted:
in development mode I want to get my log entries flushed to disk
immediately, while in production I don't want to impact the
performance of my running application by waiting for the logs.
I didn't think that the invocations needed to be made easier: I just
used "logNotice logger message", hard to do shorter.
