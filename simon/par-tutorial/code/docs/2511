Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Plugins on ghc 7.2: GHC does not export
	defaultCallbacks
Message-ID: <jdlal9$2ai$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hi all,

As a getting-my-feet-wet project I was starting to look into using 
plugins-auto with the yesod devel server, but I was quickly stymied 
because the plugins package isn't building on GHC 7.2. The error I get 
locally is the same as the one reported by hackage[1]. In short, 
defaultCallbacks seems to be gone from 7.2.

It doesn't look like that function has simply been moved. So can someone 
give me an idea about how to proceed?

Thanks!
