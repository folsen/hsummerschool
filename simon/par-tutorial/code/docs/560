You can run the build with verbose output (--verbose=3) and get more
details about why the impossible dependencies were required, or you
can build your application (whatever relies on hakyll) with cabal-dev
-- I've been able to build hakyll that way on my machine with
ghc-6.12.3, so I suspect there is some unexpected dependency in your
local package db that is causing cabal to make a series of undesirable
version selections.
