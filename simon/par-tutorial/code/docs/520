New information, may be helpful.

I manually installed hamlet 0.8 with cabal-dev, and it seemed to
install. Here is the message


Registering hamlet-0.8.0...
Installing library in
/home/mlitchard/hamlet-0.8.0/cabal-dev//lib/hamlet-0.8.0/ghc-6.12.3
Registering hamlet-0.8.0...

Then I tried to manually install yesod. Here's what I got.

mlitchard at apotheosis:~$ cd yesod-0.8.0/
mlitchard at apotheosis:~/yesod-0.8.0$ cabal-dev install
Resolving dependencies...
cabal: cannot configure yesod-0.8.0. It requires hamlet ==0.8.*
There is no available version of hamlet that satisfies ==0.8.*

I noticed it did not install in the $HOME/.cabal/ path. How do make
sure it does that?
I think if I can get it to install in the right place this will work out.
