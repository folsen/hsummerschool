I always have to smile at the complaint that something is "academic". :D

You know, like purely functional programming, that's soo academic. It's 
centered around some academic ideas, like mathematical functions, 
higher-rank types, monads and zygohistomorphic prepromorphisms, that 
have absolutely no relevance in real life, and that just don't work in 
practice. You do *not* want to write whole programs that way. At some
point, you need something that works at another level than pure 
functions. What the *hell* do you do?

I think a better invective would be "amazing".
