Please forgive me if the answer is obvious : is Darcs storage "backend
agnostic", or must it really store things in local filesystem ? AFAIK,
BitBucket team patched (internally) mercurial to allow storage to amz
s3.

I don't want to advertise for a particular key-value storage provider,
but most of them are quiet reliable and cheap. Designing a hub that
would store everything in such a key-value persistent store should not
be too hard to get right, reliable and distributed. Hosting it would be
cheap also.
