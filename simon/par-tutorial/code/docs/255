Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Patch: adding CTR,
	CMAC and SIV modes to the Crypto API
Message-ID: <4D9FAA49.7030102@xiscosoft.es>

Hi,

After a few weeks of hard work I have managed to add the CTR, CMAC and
SIV modes of operation. The implemententation passes all the KATS I
could find and is made as efficiently as possible without forgetting the
risk of timing attacks over them. The patch is attached here and you can
free it along with your library  with a BSD-3 license as long as you
recognize  the authorship.

PS: Attached is also a set of commands I used with ghci to check quickly
the implementation and which contain parts of the KATS I used, feel free
to use them.
