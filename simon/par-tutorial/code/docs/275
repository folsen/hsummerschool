Subject: [Haskell-cafe] haskell-src-meta installation failed

Hi guys,


I tried to install haskell-src-meta and got the error below.  I checked all dependencies which are listed on the hackage page, they are all installed with the right version.  Can anyone tell me what is the problem? Thanks a lot.
