==========================================================
APLAS 2011 Call For Papers

Ninth Asian Symposium on Programming Languages and Systems
Kenting, Taiwan, December 5--7, 2011
(co-located with CPP 2011)

http://flolac.iis.sinica.edu.tw/aplas11/
==========================================================

BACKGROUND:
APLAS aims at stimulating programming language research by 
providing a forum for the presentation of latest results and 
the exchange of ideas in topics concerned with programming 
languages and systems. APLAS is based in Asia, but is an 
international forum that serves the worldwide programming 
language community.

APLAS is sponsored by the Asian Association for Foundation of 
Software (AAFS) founded by Asian researchers in cooperation with 
many researchers from Europe and the USA. The past APLAS symposiums 
were successfully held in Shanghai ('10), Seoul ('09), 
Bangalore ('08), Singapore ('07), Sydney ('06), Tsukuba ('05), 
Taipei ('04) and Beijing ('03) after three informal workshops.
Proceedings of the past symposiums were published in
Springer-Verlag's LNCS 6461, 5904, 5356, 4807, 4279, 3780, 3302, 
and 2895.

The 2011 edition will be held at Kenting, a seaside resort in 
Southern Taiwan.


TOPICS:
The symposium is devoted to both foundational and practical 
issues in programming languages and systems. Papers are solicited 
on, but not limited to, the following topics:

+ semantics, logics, foundational theory;
+ design of languages and foundational calculi;
+ type systems;
+ compilers, interpreters, abstract machines;
+ program derivation and transformation;
+ program analysis, verification, model-checking, software security;
+ concurrency, constraints, domain-specific languages;
+ tools for programming, verification, implementation. 

APLAS 2011 is not limited to topics discussed in previous
symposiums. Papers identifying future directions of 
programming and those addressing the rapid changes of the 
underlying computing platforms are especially welcome. 
Demonstration of systems and tools in the scope of APLAS are 
welcome to the System and Tool presentations category. 
Authors concerned about the appropriateness of a topic are
welcome to consult with Program Chair prior to submission.


IMPORTANT DATES:
Abstract Deadline: June 13, 2011
Submission Deadline: June 17, 2011 (GMT)
Notification: August 29, 2011
Camera-Ready: September 19, 2011

INVITED SPEAKERS:
Nikolaj Bjorner, Microsoft Research Redmond
Ranjit Jhala, UC San Diego
Peter O'Hearn, Queen Mary U. London
Sriram Rajamani, Microsoft Research India

SUBMISSION INFORMATION:
We solicit submissions in two categories:

Regular research papers, describing original research results,
including tool development and case studies, from a perspective of
scientific research. Regular research papers should not exceed 16
pages in the Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and
figures. They should clearly identify what has been accomplished and
why it is significant. Submissions will be judged on the basis of
significance, relevance, correctness, originality, and clarity. In
case of lack of space, proofs, experimental results, or any
information supporting the technical results of the paper could be
provided as Appendix or a link to a web page.

System and Tool presentations, describing systems or tools that
support theory, program construction, reasoning, and/or program
execution in the scope of APLAS. Unlike presentations of regular
research papers, presentation of accepted papers in this category is
expected to be centered around a demonstration. The paper and the
demonstration should identify the novelties of the tools and use
motivating examples. System and Tool papers should not
exceed 8 pages in the Springer LNCS format, including bibliography and
figures. Submissions will be judged based on both the papers and the
systems or tools as described in the papers. It is highly desirable
that the tools are available on the web.

Papers should be submitted electronically via the submission web page
at http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aplas2011. Acceptable
formats are PostScript or PDF, viewable by Ghostview or Acrobat
Reader. Submitted papers must be unpublished and not submitted for
publication elsewhere. Papers must be written in English. The
proceedings are planned to be published as a volume in
Springer-Verlag's Lecture Notes in Computer Science series. Accepted
papers must be presented at the conference.
