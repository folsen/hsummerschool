Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Linear types using kinds?
Message-ID: <5D2EEA29-EA4B-4E37-A763-9118B065552E@gmail.com>

Hey everyone!

So, I was on LtU reading about F*

	http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4318

and an idea just occurred to me which *must* have occurred to someone smarter than me, so I would love your feedback on the following question:

Could Haskell be extended to support linear/affine types (in order to have, for example, more efficient resource management) by extending the kind system to include such types?  Or, even if the answer were yes, does the use of monads and higher-order types (like those used in "runST" function for the ST monad) make linear/affine types completely redundant in Haskell.

Thanks a lot!
Greg
