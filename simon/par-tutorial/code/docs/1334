No, that will effectively make it impossible to make use of CPS effects,
hence turning your ContT into an IdentityT-like monad transformer, which
can only change the semantics of the underlying monad.  More concretely
what you are implementing here is a codensity as you can find it in the
monad-ran package by Edward K.
