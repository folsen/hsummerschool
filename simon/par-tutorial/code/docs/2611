Ah, then you would block one thread on another if the host info is in
the map? I get it.

Strictly one socket per host might be a tricky invariant to maintain -
you'd have to insert an empty socket MVar in the map on lookup
failure, and the shuffling of the nested MVars seems tricky off the
top of my head.

But even without all of that I don't think you'd be flooding the host
any more than without any keepalive support, which was what I was
getting at.

This is just speculation on my part - I don't have a stake in this, it
just sounded like an interesting problem. I'd hate to be steering this
into a design black hole.
