Have a reference for when it was actually implemented?

I tried to look this up, and got this:

http://0pointer.de/blog/projects/locking.html

Sounds like it's not so "solved" after all. (Or perhaps the author just 
doesn't know enough about it, it's hard to say...) The Wikipedia page on 
file locking also points out a list of Unix-related locking problems. 
(But again, that might just be editor bias.)

Good, that was my main point. Now, who's volunteering to implement all 
this? :-}
