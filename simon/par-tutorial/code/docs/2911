I would not want to rely on that.

Yes. Code you write can be under any license you like. When someone uses
the combination then they have to comply with all the licenses (so
implicitly there's the constraint that the license you pick must be
compatible with the license of the other parts).

Not sure. In practice I don't think you can achieve that with our
toolchain.
