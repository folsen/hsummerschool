At the moment, cabal-dev ghci just uses the -package-conf and
-no-user-package-conf flags to restrict ghci to the sandboxed and
global package dbs.

It's difficult to do more without parsing the content of the project's
cabal file, and that parser isn't exposed through a library api (it's
in cabal-install), which makes it a little difficult to use.
