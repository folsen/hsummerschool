Nice work!

The view file part seems to have problems with utf-8 encoded files:
http://handra.rampa.sk/dawb/view?repoVURL=http%3A%2F%2Fcode.haskell.org%2Fnumerals&repoVFile=test%2FText%2FNumeral%2FLanguage%2FZH%2FTestData.hs

It is unreadable even when explicitly asking my browser to decode the
document as UTF-8. This makes me suspect the problem is in the code
that processes files to produce the HTML.

I have no solution ready for this problem. Each file could potentially
use a different encoding.

Apart from this inconvenience your tool looks very useful.

Regards,
Roel
