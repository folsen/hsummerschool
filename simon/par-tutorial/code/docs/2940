You might have read about "free theorems" arising from types. They are a 
method to derive certain properties about a value that must hold, only 
looking at its type. For example, a value

 > x :: a

can't be anything else than bottom, a function

 > f :: [a] -> [a]

must commute with 'map', etc. For more information you may be interested 
in "Theorems for free"[1] by Philip Wadler.
