Subject: [Haskell-cafe] GHC 7.4 and binutils-gold
Message-ID: <CAKA2JgJ-igsuMAqPV6Y7Y1S8hmP8RjtjiOrxKczF1_+8iJt=Fg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

One other little GHC 7.4 note. When I first tried building code with
it, I got the following error message:

/usr/bin/ld: --hash-size=31: unknown option

Once I uninstalled binutils-gold, everything went just fine. Has
anyone else experienced this? I'm running Ubuntu Oneiric.

Michael
