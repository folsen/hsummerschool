It has to do with the termination partial ordering -- the least solutions
give a denotational description that's equivalent to what recursion computes.

In this case, the least solutions are

	some Nothing = Nothing
	some (Just x) = _|_

	many Nothing = Just []
	many (Just x) = _|_

It's easy to verify that these are solutions, and that they're less
defined than the versions above.
