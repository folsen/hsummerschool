If you just compile it normally you have an unexported binding called "main"
which is effectively (and actually, when compiled with optimization)
discarded.  If you do

    ghc --make --main-is GameState GameState.hs

then GHC will use GameState.main as the entry point (instead of Main.main)
and build a program instead of a library.
