My own "buildwrapper" package (available from github and hackage) uses
both haskell-src-exts and the GHC API to provide the same kind of
services to the EclipseFP IDE plugins. You may be able to use it
directly for your purpose or at least have a look at the code to get a
feel for how to use the GHC API.

Hope this helps
