First thing to try is always --make; GHC's default behavior is, shall we
say, not optimal otherwise.  (I consider it highly broken; somewhere in
there the default is *supposedly* going to change to --make, I believe.)  If
you want to try to make it work the ugly old way, the symbol names suggest
to me that "-package haskell98" would help.
