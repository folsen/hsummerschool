Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANN: Hakyll 3.1
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=Mm1KCJKgk86P3bXp=P0RCuVy=ig@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

I've just uploaded Hakyll 3.1.0.0 [1] to Hackage. It contains some
backwards-incompatible changes (but they are really for the greater
good).

The most important change is the matching done in the rules DSL. What
used to be written as:

    route "posts/*" someRoute
    compile "posts/*" someCompiler

Is now written as:

    match "posts/*" $ do
        route someRoute
        compile someCompiler

This new style is way more expressive, as you can define custom
predicates such as:

    match (predicate (\i -> matches "foo/*" i && not (matches
"foo/bar" i))) $ do ...

For more information, see the Pattern documentation [2].

Another slight change is that the `Hakyll.Web.Tags` [3] module now
uses an association list instead of a `Data.Map` -- in case you want
to change the order in which tags are displayed.

If you have any questions or trouble migrating, feel free to drop a
mail to me or here [4] or visit us in #hakyll on Freenode.
