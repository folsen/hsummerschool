Subject: [Haskell-cafe] How to get Cabal to spit out a .a library suitable
	for linking into C/Objective-C
Message-ID: <CAH6e9LjZ1YEQt99B9sier-9sJNqq+zviGkEOoMK_h-AHN_EOyw@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy,

I'm trying to figure out how to get Cabal configured to compile and link my
Haskell code such that the code can be part of C and/or Objective-C code
such that all the Haskell dependencies are rolled into a .a file and can be
linked by a normal C linker (e.g., ld).

I've been through
http://haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.2/html/users_guide/ffi-ghc.html#using-own-mainand
the associated linked, but I'm unable to find out the Cabal
incantation
to output a library that's linkable into my other code.  Any pointers or
examples would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

David
