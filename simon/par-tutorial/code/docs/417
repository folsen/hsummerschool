Well that's no fun! The install looks like it mostly worked, execept that
the final registration of the installed packages failed because for some
reason the script has them out of order.

You can "fix up" your install by doing this:

cd /Library/Haskell/ghc-7.0.2/lib/registrations
for c in *.conf; do echo == $c ==; ghc-pkg register --force $c; done


I'll have to look into why that build of the package got the files out of
order...
