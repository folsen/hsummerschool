Hello,


      I know nothing about the architecture of iOS running on an iPad.
However, I have a friend who just bought the newer iPad. It seems that
either C++ or Objective C is available on iPad for development(actually the
icon says C++). What are the prospects of getting Haskell ported to iOS?
