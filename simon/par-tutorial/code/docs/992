Hi, there is a conflict between ghc' libiconv and Ports installed libiconv.
make sure first sudo port deactivate -f libiconv
then install again, it should work.
however, it is very ugly since your other port installed libraries needs 
libiconv, like gnuplot, so when you need port installed libiconv,
sudo port activate -f libiconv again.
