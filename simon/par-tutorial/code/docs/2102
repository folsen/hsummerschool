I am building http://visi.pro on Haskell.  I am doing it for a number of
reasons:

   - Haskell is a mature platform that provides lots of goodies that I
   might otherwise have to write (like the goodies I wrote in Lift including
   an Actors library)
   - Haskell allows a lot of nice "things" that make building a language
   and associated tools easier (like laziness)
   - Haskell is a filter for team members. Just like Foursquare uses Scala
   as a filter for candidates in recruiting, I'm using Haskell as a filter...
   if you have some good Haskell open source code, it's a way to indicate to
   me that you're a strong developer.
