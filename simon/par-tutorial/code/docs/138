I recommend joining the prime list. It is very low traffic and the
place where language changes should be discussed.

My intention is that every time you need an encoding for Haskell
sources, it must be UTF-8. At least if you want to call it Haskell.
This is not limited to compilers but concerns all tools that process
Haskell sources.

An IDE and database are free to store sources any way they see fit.
But as soon as you want to exchange that source with some standards
conforming system it must be encoded as UTF-8.

This is an interesting example. What distinguishes this scenario from
others is that there is a clear understanding between two parties
(client and server) how a file should be interpreted. I could word my
proposal in such a way that it only concerns situations where such a
prior agreement doesn't or can't exist. For example, when storing
source on a file system.
