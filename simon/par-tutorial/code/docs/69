Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Can't connect to local yackage server
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=K_LxbjW6u2MvQifNtswTa9-5bRQ@mail.gmail.com>

On Mac OS X 10.6.7, after upgrading to yackage 0.1.0.1:

After running yackage -l, I cannot connect to it even directly
from localhost. I get the message:

  This Yackage server only talks to local clients

On a Linux server it seems to work fine though.

On the Mac, when I do "telnet localhost" I get:

  Trying ::1...

Could it be that yackage 0.1.0.1 doesn't recognize the
IPv6 notion of localhost?

Thanks,
Yitz
