Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Second call for submissions: Monad.Reader special
 poetry and fiction edition
Message-ID: <20110208192849.GA25852@seas.upenn.edu>

Ten days until the submission deadline.
"Nein": what I won't take for an answer.
Eighth to eighteenth February,
Seven thousand minutes twice,
Sick's he who can't write aught.
Five submissions now;
Four more, at least?
Three'd be fair
To no-
One.
