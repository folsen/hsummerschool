That module is something I really hate, since every time I develop
something that uses any form of HTTP there's a package that indirectly
pulls crypto-api.  Since there are many times where I use cabal-dev or
virthual-env, the party begins!

So I guess you could e-mail crypto-api's maintainer and express your
dissatisfaction?  crypto-api is meant to be a core package in
Haskell's cryptography world, this situation is far from ideal.
