I don't have a better design to suggest, but I think this may end up more
complicated than you want. In particular, it will probably be complicated to
make a collection of characters that have e.g. an Armor but maybe any
other stuff.

If you do want to use this sort of design, check out Wouter Swiestra's
paper "Data Type a la Cart".
