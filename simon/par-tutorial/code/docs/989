My usually technique for solving readline-related issues is to rip-out
readline from whatever I want to build, substituting in Haskeline if I
want nice editing.

It isn't very scientific, but I find it to be a more interesting
problem to solve.

I've given this a try in the Lambdabot source, but I'm getting
unrelated errors building it so I'm not sure it works.

Ripping out readline should be a brief bit of hacking in
Plugin/OfflineRC.hs, from what I can tell.
