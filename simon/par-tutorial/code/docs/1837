Okay, I just wasn't reading closely enough.

We generalized the type of 'notFollowedBy' in parsec-3 - the
generalization isn't parsec-3 specific at all, it just hadn't been
done yet.

The intent of the compatibility module was to supply backwards
compatibility - I never thought about the problems of forward
compatibility.

Maybe some warning or deprecation pragmas are in order.
