In this particular case, you could argue that more people know PHP and
Python than Ruby, so surely one should avoid Ruby as well.

Managers like to think of their company as a factory, and from this
perspective, it makes sense to build your factory from easily obtainable
parts.  But the factory mindset only works when you want to manufacture
stuff, nobody who takes a minute to actually think will say that you can
replace any programmer with any other, as long as they know the same
programming language or framework.

Anyway, here's something I found interesting in that respect:

(This probably turned out less helpful than I intended, sorry :-)
