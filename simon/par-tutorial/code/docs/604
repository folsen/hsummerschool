I think that other version control systems just assume that a new patch
depends on _all_ existing patches.



Mentally I am still comparing Darcs with Subversion, that is, what my
colleagues use. Thus I am even happy with Darcs-1. :-) Sure, sometimes I
have to re-record several patches, when I forgot to download latest
patches from a repository before recording my own ones. My rule of thumb
is, that I must avoid merges at all costs.
