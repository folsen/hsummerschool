Alas, Hugs appears to be well and truly dead. Sept2006 seems to be the 
last official release, and the bugs I've posted for Cabal/cabal-install 
support seem to have a priority hovering around _|_.

You can get an unofficial Feb2009 release from the corehugs[1] project 
that forked off in 2008. Unfortunately corehugs seems to be dead too 
(along with the Yhc it was forked to work with).

Tis a shame to see all those projects go. It'd be nice to have a simple, 
portable Haskell interpreter for shell scripting, embedded machines, etc.
