Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ImProve Tutorial
Message-ID: <BANLkTikr3RXVhxavocELJUqV5RJVbbWvBg@mail.gmail.com>

ImProve is a Haskell eDSL for embedded control systems -- we use it
for automotive and off-highway powertrain control.

I've started writing a tutorial for ImProve.  So far it has a basic
tour of the language and a handful of examples.  Comments and
suggestions are welcome.

In other recent news, ImProve can now generate models in Simulink and Modelica.
