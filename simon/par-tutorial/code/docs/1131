I should actually mention that this is a double infelicity:  the OP has a
gmail.com address.  gmail has an annoying tendency to add every address
you've ever sent mail to to your primary address book; so telling something
like LinkedIn to send invites to your address book, with the reasonable
expectation that that means your actual contacts, suddenly turns into
spamming the (your) known universe.
