Hi Evan

The EHC compiler code base seems to use mbSomething as a convention.

As EHC has quite a lot of textual information in its source - the code
is Haskell + attribute grammars + Shuffle + plus more - the mb
convention seems to work well and I adopted it for myself after seeing
it there.

These days I do like all lower case for variables though (unless the
variables are functions and need better names than f g or fn).

Best wishes

Stephen
