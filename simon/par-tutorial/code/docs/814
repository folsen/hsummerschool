Subject: [Haskell-cafe] GHC repositories
Message-ID: <BANLkTi=yoOKJTnWznpmrQgN35jJeYCKTFw@mail.gmail.com>

Now that GHC has a git
repository<http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Repositories>,
could that change be reflected in the docs<http://www.haskell.org/ghc/download>
?

It's hard to work with folks on Trac to debug GHC when I can't find the
latest version (changesets are now git, not svn).

Cheers,
