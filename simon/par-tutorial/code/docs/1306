It might not be what _you_ want, but it might be what others want.  If
you're concerned with efficiency, then wouldn't you use length rather
than genericLength?

I take it back, it doesn't seem to be possible due to the design of
ListLilke.  You need to define the instance explicitly (there are only
four functions you have to define, but for performance reasons you
probably want to re-define all of them).
