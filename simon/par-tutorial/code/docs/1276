Thanks for running this again: very informative.



"We ought to be able to write a library with a Par monad for distributed
parallel algorithms."

If someone were to do this they might want to start here:

"I've started thinking about writing a medium sized tutorial, perhaps 60
pages or so, covering everything you need to know to be able to write
production quality Haskell code."

This would be such a valuable resource for the community.

Tom
