Shame on me, I forgot to include the software versions I use:

$ ghc --version
The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 6.12.3

$ uname -a
Linux raptor 2.6.37-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Jan 29 20:00:33 CET 2011 x86_64
Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU 870 @ 2.93GHz GenuineIntel GNU/Linux

This is a normal Arch Linux setup with GHC installed via pacman.

Best regards,
Krzysztof Skrz?tnicki
