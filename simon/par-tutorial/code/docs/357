Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: TCache 0.8
Message-ID: <BANLkTikJZJfVV4xREX70CO=fZ5kxkKv97g@mail.gmail.com>

Tired of your persistence layer?

Take persistence the haskelll way. Besides the backward compatible stuff,
TCache now defines persistent STM variables (DBRef's) that  leverages the
traditional haskell reference syntax to perform fast in-memory database
transactions and inter-object references. It includes indexing, triggers and
an straightforward pure-haskell query language based on record field
relations.

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/TCache-0.8.0.2

This version includes a lot of changes and must be considered beta. Please
submit any bugs, comments and so on.

Cheers!
