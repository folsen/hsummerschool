Don't use that package: it's broken.  I did start on a re-write that
works (and there are similar libraries around that I believe do work),
but gave up because it was a) too fiddly, and b) I decided that the
use case I had for them wasn't worth it (as it would just make that
library more complicated and difficult to use, possibly also less
efficient).  If anyone wants it I can certainly send them what I've
got though.
