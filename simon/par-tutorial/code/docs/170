Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: DocTest-0.2.0
Message-ID: <20110406164647.GA7363@x200>

I just uploaded a new version of DocTest[1] to Hackage.


WHAT IS DocTest?
================

DocTest is a port of Python's doctest[2] to Haskell.  It can be used to
verify, that examples in Haddock comments[3] do still work.  This also
provides you with a simple mechanism to write unit test, without the
burden of maintaining a dedicated test suite.

A basic example of usage is at [4].


WHAT'S NEW IN THIS VERSION?
===========================

Support for blank lines in the result of an expression (analogous to the
<BLANKLINE>-feature of Python's doctest).  Here is an example of usage:

    -- |
    -- Some example:
    --
    -- >>> putStrLn "foo\n\nbar"
    -- foo
    -- <BLANKLINE>
    -- bar

Currently this is implemented in DocTest, but we will move it to Haddock
with the next release.

Cheers,
Simon
