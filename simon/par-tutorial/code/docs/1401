For a 100%-accurate answer, one would need the full history of what you 
did to your computer, which no one knows.

For a 99%-accurate answer, the outputs of "ghc -v" and "ghc-pkg list -v" 
are very good post-mortem information.

A 90%-accurate answer: Given the incomplete information (that's right, 
"ghc-pkg check" is incomplete), there is 90% probability that you lost 
template-haskell, and you must reinstall haskell platform. (No, building 
a new instance of template-haskell is not enough. Generally, replacing 
or overriding libs that come with GHC does not work. See my 
http://www.vex.net/~trebla/haskell/sicp.xhtml )
