John, please do - darcs folks are longing for a really good hub. You're probably aware of patch-tag and darcsden - 
perhaps you can exceed or reuse those ? Both are good but have maintainers now focussed elsewhere. Running a robust 
scalable public darcs hub is difficult. I think darcs developers are keen to help anyone working on that. FYI codehole 
seems access-restricted.
