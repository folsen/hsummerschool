That is what is happening (you can confirm with "ghc -v").

Interestingly, you can work around by compiling with -I. on the command line:

{{{

mbolingbroke at equinox ~/Junk/lhscpp
$ cat Test.lhs Included.h
> {-# LANGUAGE CPP #-}
> module Main (main) where

#include "MachDeps.h"
#include "Included.h"

> main :: IO ()
> main = print MY_CONSTANT
#define MY_CONSTANT 2
mbolingbroke at equinox ~/Junk/lhscpp
$ ./Test
2
}}}

Perhaps worth filing a bug report?

Cheers
Max
