Subject: [Haskell-cafe]  Extending GHCi
Message-ID: <AANLkTintbzM_qEmFH=ijc5NudTTuk=eHqLYX1SAcXZ__@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am looking for a way to extend GHCI such that I can do something like this

$ ghci
GHCi, version 6.12.3: http://www.haskell.org/ghc/  :? for help
Loading package ghc-prim ... linking ... done.
Loading package integer-gmp ... linking ... done.
Loading package base ... linking ... done.
Loading package ffi-1.0 ... linking ... done.
Prelude> startMyFunction
Prelude>

startMyFunction will do a forkIO and listen on a network port for
interaction with a remote process and will drop back to GHCI prompt where I
can invoke haskell functions that'll control the way the interaction with
the remote process occurs. Can this be done?

Regards,
Kashyap
