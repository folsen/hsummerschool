Message-ID: <BANLkTikuDmTioubSMCpueG38xksq6rRUow@mail.gmail.com>

   Welcome to issue 178 of the HWN, a newsletter covering developments in
   the Haskell community. This release covers the week of April 10 to
   16, 2011.

Announcements

   Simon Marlow commented (http://goo.gl/XythI) on plans to have a
Hackathon at MSR Cambridge
   this summer.

   Dr. Heinrich Hordegen informed us (http://goo.gl/lQvqw) of the
creation of a Munich
   funtional programmers' user group. Help us spread the word to anyone
   interested in functional programming in general.

   Eric Y. Kow announced (http://goo.gl/PYdKI) the creation of the
parallel-haskell mailing
   list. "The group exists to bring together the various groups in the
   Haskell community that are working on parallelism. It is intended to
   provide some visibility into the various efforts and to encourage
   collaboration."

   Don Stewart announced (http://goo.gl/0nWn2) the release of the
Haskell Platform
   2011.2.0.1. "This release adds support for GHC 7.0.3, and significant
   improvements for Mac OS X users."

Quotes of the Week

     * Gregory Collins: "Easy to use" and "high performance" don't have to
       be contradictory, but you shouldn't neglect the latter.

     * xplat: haskell is good for portability. it can run well on any sort
       of x86 unix, which is all there is after all.

     * Spockz: it's just that my first name isn't Simon so I'm not allowed
       to use unsafePerformIO :P

     * djahandarie: Category theorists are morphisms for turning cofree
       theorems into free theorems.

     * monochrom: lambdabot is partially broken and partially correct when
       it comes to utf-8

     * mm_freak: > case analysis of syntax -> bullshit <lambdabot> True
