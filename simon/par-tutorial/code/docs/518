You might learn more by issuing the configure / build steps manually
(I think `cabal configure` will produce an error).  Upping the
verbosity will also help:

# get pages and pages of details:
$ cabal install --verbose=3

I would first suggest trying cabal-dev, though (cab can delegate to
cabal-dev now too, but I haven't played with it yet).

$ cabal-dev install yesod-0.8

will either work or fail in a way that we can more easily reproduce.
