To this end I sometimes wrote a dummy module containing more 
documentation. In the Cabal description file I refer to this module with 
a quotation like "Module". This way, I can even organize the 
documentation in chapters. I added DEPRECATED pragmas to these modules, 
in order to prevent people from importing them.
