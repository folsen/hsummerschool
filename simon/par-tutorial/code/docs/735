GLFW is the package that failed to install.  The reason for that should be
in the scroll back somewhere but it can often be hard to find when it's
buried in a huge list of compilation messages.  If you try with just GLFW,
eg., cabal install GLFW, then it should be easier to spot the error.

Since you're on a mac, I would highly recommend getting the latest haskell
platform.  You're on 7.0.2 which has bug fixes that are relevant to build
failures on OSX, as I understand it.
