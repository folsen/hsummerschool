To anyone who is interested,

I just uploaded a new release of hxournal 0.6 which has pdf annotation
functionality. (It's still at very early stage now though. You can
think this as a tech preview release)

The following is the message I posted on hxournal google group. (
http://groups.google.com/group/hxournal )
All small release announcements will be posted there.

Thanks.

best,
IW

Dear hxournal Users,
I uploaded the new version of hxournal with pdf annotation
functionality to hackage so that one can easily test the new version.
The new version is accompanied with new releases of xournal-render and
xournal-parser and with new package xournal-types and xournal-builder,
which are data type declaration package for xournal and xournal file
constructing library using blaze-builder.
For installation, you just need to type
> cabal install hxournal

This hxournal version needs poppler-0.12.* which is a part of gtk2hs.
I found that the installation of poppler package is a little difficult
in some system.  So you may encounter some problem in installation.
Later, I will make a compilation option to choose whether one will use
poppler or not.

Happy hxournaling then!

best regards,
Ian-Woo Kim
