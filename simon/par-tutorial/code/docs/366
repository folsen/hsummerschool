Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Syntastic support for cabal
Message-ID: <42090BD8CB3B40659D2E629F0EAC82C4@gmail.com>

Hi all

I'm using Haskell mode for Vim, as well as syntastic. I've found syntastic particularly useful as I'm quite new to Haskell and sometimes get the types of my functions wrong.

When working on Cabal packages however, syntastic marks import statements which import modules local to the cabal package as being incorrect because the module cannot be found. Has anyone solved this, or do you have pointers on how I can?

Thanks
