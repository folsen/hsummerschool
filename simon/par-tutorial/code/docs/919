Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Fractional Part

Hi everyone,
I'm totally new to Haskell and functional programming. I try to solve  
some problems from Proejct Euler with Haskell so that I can improve  
myself in functional programming.
In the first step I want to write a little code that can give me only  
the decimal part of a float. For instance:
if the number is (0.123) I want to obtain only the (123) part to do  
some processes on that. (I mean the result of this code must be an  
integer.)
I don't expect any complete code, any suggestion and help will be  
appreciated.
Thanks
Ata
