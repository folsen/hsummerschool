Asking honest questions is imminently reasonable; accusing others of being incompetent hypocrites --- especially when you go to great length to make it clear that this is *exactly* what you are doing --- is not.  The former is helpful, but the latter is poisonous.  Yves's point is that doing the latter risks scaring people away.
