Hi!

Is there for <$> (fmap) operator some nice looking symbol in mathematics, LaTeX?

I am looking here:

http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.html
http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/6.12.1/html/libraries/base/Control-Applicative.html

but only for other operators there are nice symbols, and <$> is left as it is.

I have also tried \mathbin{<\$>} but it adds space around $ (at least
in lhs2tex), so it looks ugly.
