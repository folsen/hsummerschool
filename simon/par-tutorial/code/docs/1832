Yes, see 

  http://xmonad.org/xmonad-docs/xmonad-contrib/XMonad-Hooks-EwmhDesktops.html

xmonad itself does not provide something which the user can click on
to switch windows, but if you use some other window-switcher program
(e.g. one that comes with your favorite DE) the above module can be
used to make xmonad to respond to it.
