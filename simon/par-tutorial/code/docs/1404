Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Project Euler: request for comments
Message-ID: <CAPkMFPnCdD4Od5ff6AZ8pu5peR_puk2y+ygZeuPLPX_Y4tUPhw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I order to improve my Haskell skills I started (again) to solve the
project euler problems with this language.
I am now at problem 11 and would really appreciate any comment about
my code in order to make it more elegant or efficient.

My solutions can be found here: http://fp.opicasso.com/tag/projecteuler
