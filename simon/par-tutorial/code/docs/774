Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Good reads?
Message-ID: <4DB73D9E.5080604@gmail.com>

[I originally posted this over in haskell-beginners. However, since this
list has a lot more traffic, and I am not sure how many people read both
lists, I thought I would post here as well. I apologize for the
doublepost! Just want to make sure I can get some replies from the great
people here who might not read the beginners list]

Hey all,

I have mostly been brought in imperative/OOP languages. In connection
with my college studies, however, I have taken great interest in the
functional paradigm, and would very much like to dig deeper into it.

I am currently reading through Peyton-Jones "Haskell: The Craft of
Functional Programming" (2nd ed.), as well as a great paper published by
one of my professors
(http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.html). However, what
other works, in your opinions, should I look into to get a more complete
understanding of functional programming?

Thanks in advance!

Chris
