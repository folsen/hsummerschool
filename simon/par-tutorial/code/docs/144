Don't. Basically, don't upgrade any libraries that come with GHC itself 
(afaik, Cabal can be upgraded without causing havoc, everything(?) else 
should only be upgraded when you know exactly what you're doing).

time is one of GHC's bootlibs, it shouldn't be upgraded either. You'll get 
some stuff depending on the original time and other stuff depending on the 
new one, it won't work together, so things will break - unless you know 
exactly what you're doing.

Something expected the haskell98 package that came with GHC and found the 
newly installed, it seems.

Looks like you've done a global install and thus have overwritten the 
original. I'm afraid that means you have to reinstall GHC, I know of no way 
to fix it.
