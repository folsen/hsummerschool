Subject: [Haskell-cafe] library-profiling default
Message-ID: <CAH1Pdbm6NC+LJLmJ+zK_vKEK+kEAqSiGcAn1KrsbTfXYLdSRMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi
Is there a good reason that the default for library-profiling in
.cabal/config is set to False? It seems a lot of people hit the problem of
trying to profile for the first time, finding it doesn't work because
profiling libraries haven't been installed, then they have to walk the
dependencies reinstalling everything.

Is there a major cost or problem with just defaulting this to True?

Apologies if this is answered elsewhere, I saw various discussions on why it
is difficult to automatically build required libs with profiling on demand,
but nothing that discussed changing the default so that they are always
built.
Tom
