If we were starting from a clean sheet (no pun intended) then yes, I
would say this is unquestionably preferable.

Given the amount of Haskell code out in the world, I'd expect people to
argue against it, on the basis that fiddling with the types is quite a
major change. (Though I would not necessarily be one of those people)
