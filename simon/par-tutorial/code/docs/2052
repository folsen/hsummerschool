Ah, true. Sorry.

Myself, I think it's quite clear by the axioms given, but I certainly
shan't grouch about more/better documentation.

Actually, now that I think of it, they are not, in general, the least
converging solutions -- in the case of a parser, for example, (some
(pure x)) would nevertheless diverge (I think).
Perhaps "least sane solutions" (^_^)
