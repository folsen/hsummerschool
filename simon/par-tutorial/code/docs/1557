(Identity :+: Store s) is a comonad that is also instance of Pointed, but 
I do not believe it is an instance Applicative.

newtype SemiStore s a = (Identity :+: Store s) a

instance Pointed (SemiStore s) where
   pure a = Inl (Identity a)

Coalgebras of the (Identity :+: Store s) comonad form the type of partial 
lenses so this isn't just an academic functor.
