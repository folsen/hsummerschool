Cool. I have a vague memory of seeing it, but not paying much attention to it.

One can turn it on in Xcode 4.2 by Edit -> Format -> Substitutions -> Show Substitutions and click Text Replacement or selecting it directly in the Substitutions menu. This popup windows allows one to apply it a text selection. (And similar in other programs, like Mail.)

For example, I set one entry so that typing x |-> a becomes x ? a, the TeX \mapsto, in Unicode ? RIGHTWARDS ARROW FROM BAR U+21A6.

It might be tedious to make a lot of entries, though, but something to start with.
