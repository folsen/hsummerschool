Maybe the Zord64_HARD.lhs is at fault for not using qualified module
names? I can't see why this would be the case though, but at look at
the source shows it doesn't.

In future, please could you put some information about your problem **
at the top ** of your message rather than burying it many lines down
in a log. It is then more likely to catch the eye of a relevant party.
