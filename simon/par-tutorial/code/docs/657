Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: iteratee-compress 0.2.0.0
Message-ID: <1303554570.3911.8.camel@localhost.localdomain>

Iteratee-compress provides compressing and decompressing enumerators
including flushing (using John Lato's implementation). Currently only
gzip and bzip is provided but LZMA is planned.

Changes from previous version:
 - Add BZip support

Next goals:
 - LZMA support
 - Generic interface for flushing

To think about:
 - Should inner iteratee be able to request flushing

Regards
