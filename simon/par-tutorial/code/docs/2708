I managed to track down the problem at last. And, as might be expected 
after staring at it for so long, it was a fairly boneheaded thing. Turns 
out the error was from an entirely different thread which is using 
Attoparsec and a modified version of attoparsec-iteratee. I never 
suspected this thread because I'd previously verified the correctness of 
the parser (which is indeed correct). The problem is a coworker changed 
the format of the file that thread was reading, and I'd never bothered 
to give the parser robust and helpful error messages <chagrin>

Thanks all, for helping with the latent bugs in the code I posted and 
for convincing me that I really wasn't just missing something there.
