Subject: [Haskell-cafe] darcs repo browser

Hi,

there is one haskell web application based on happstack for viewing
foreign darcs repos exposed only on pure HTTP servers.
I need that for checking status of some repositories when I don't have
access to darcs binary/shell... maybe it can be useful for somebody
else too.

Service is running on following URL: http://handra.rampa.sk/dawb/changes
See more comments on http://rampa.sk/static/dawb.html

Regarding RSS feeds - Please send me a note If you find the hourly
cron job I run on some repos to produce feeds too expensive for your
server resources.
It does not obey robots.txt file yet.

Regards,
Rado
