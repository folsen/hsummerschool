1) Use "Text" as the string type, not "String"

2) Re: SimpleLogger: writing to and flushing the log file upon
receiving each message is absolutely the wrong thing to do in
high-performance code. Each write() is a context switch into the
kernel, and doing it this way will kill your throughput (in messages
per second). What we do in our webserver (which relies on
high-throughput access logging) is to buffer messages to the log
channel in memory, and perform the actual writes in a separate worker
thread no more often than once every N seconds.

"Easy to use" and "high performance" don't have to be contradictory,
but you shouldn't neglect the latter.
