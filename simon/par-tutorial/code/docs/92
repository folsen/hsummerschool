Does the LLVMXCoreAsmPrinter library exist on your machine? If not, then
certainly building LLVM went wrong. If it exists then my next question
would be, whether this is a particular problem with LLVMXCoreAsmPrinter
or whether this is just the first library GHC tried to bind to.

I could suggest to try to build the current state of the package from
   http://code.haskell.org/llvm/
 but I suspect that the building problem would be the same.

llvm-ht was a little modification by me. In the meantime I could
incorporate my changes to the main llvm package. I may flag llvm-ht as
deprecated.

Btw. there is also the haskell-llvm mailing list.
