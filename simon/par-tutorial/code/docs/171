Subject: [Haskell-cafe] mtlx has a nice design but is slow
Message-ID: <BANLkTinQJMF224HsM2reEK+iQ2TzVU4nNg@mail.gmail.com>

I just refactored my type and transform system prototype (introduced in [1]
but changed since then) from using mtlx [2] (type-indexed monad transformers
described in [3]) to mtl using RWST. mtlx allowed me to cleanly separate the
various monadic components in a convenient way. Unfortunately, I found it to
be too slow. The refactoring was an experiment to see how slow. I was rather
surprised:

Running time of a compiled main with a list of tests:
  mtlx (7 transformers): 2 min 52 sec
  mtl (RWST): 0 min 13 sec

It's frustrating to see such a huge performance gap for a better design.

Regards,
Sean
