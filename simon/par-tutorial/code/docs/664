Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Storing failing testcases for QuickCheck
Message-ID: <iouf55$7cp$1@dough.gmane.org>

Hi!

I would like to have a library that would allow to use QuickCheck in the 
normal manner, but it would save test data for failing properties on the 
filesystem (maybe using the shiny new acid-state?). On consecutive test 
runs, the saved test data would be used first (before generating new 
arbitrary test data). I think, this would come in quite handy when doing 
test driven development.

Any comments on this? Does something like this already exist?

Cheers,
S?nke
