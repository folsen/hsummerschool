Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Getting segmentation fault when profiling,
	despite `-K100M'.
Message-ID: <1313503012.9770.9.camel@dbanas-eeepc>

Hi all,

I'm trying to profile a mixed language program, in which Haskell is NOT
the top layer and does not contain the `main' function. (C is/does.)

Is this effort doomed to fail?

I'm getting a segmentation fault, as soon as the first Haskell function
is called, despite having included `-K100M' in my list of +RTS args:

 19     int argc = 5;
 20     char* argv[] = {"ghcDll",
 21                     "+RTS",
 22                     "-hc",
 23                     "-p",
 24                     "-K100M",
 25                     NULL}; // argv must end with NULL
 26 
 27     // Initialize Haskell runtime
 28     char** args = argv;
 29     hs_init(&argc, &args);

Using gdb to trace through the C-code, up until the first call to
Haskell, I get to here:

 64     // Call the Haskell function.
 65     res = amiInit(
 66         impulse_matrix,
 67         row_size,

Here's the beginning of `amiInit':

 41 -- Our Haskell implementation of `AMI_Init'.
 42 amiInit :: Ptr CDouble -> CInt -> CInt -> CDouble -> CDouble ->
 43            CString -> Ptr CString -> Ptr (StablePtr AmiModel) -> Ptr
CString -> IO Int
 44 amiInit impulse_matrix row_size aggressors sample_interval bit_time
 45         ami_parameters_in ami_parameters_out ami_memory_handle
msgHndl
 46     | impulse_matrix == nullPtr = return 0
 47     | otherwise = do
 48         putStrLn "I'm here."

I never see "I'm here." printed to my console, before I get the
segmentation fault.

Any thoughts?

Thanks,
-db
