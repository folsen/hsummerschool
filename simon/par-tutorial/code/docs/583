I have two projects, one has about 50k lines of C code thats kept in
Bzr and the other has 50k lines of Haskell code thats kept in Darcs.
They both have similar sized commit and branch histories.

I find the speed on Bzr and Darcs on those two projects to be pretty
much the same. Most operations on a local repo take well less than 5
seconds. Git may be faster but if its under 5 seconds who cares.
