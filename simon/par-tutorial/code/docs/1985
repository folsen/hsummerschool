That's good to know! I presume it's something like Haskell98 to start with?
I'd be even more impressed (and possibly also concerned for your health) if
you were going to tackle all of the extensions!

I've been trying to find a student to write a haskell-src-exts type checker
for me. It should use a particular kind of mechanism though, using
constraints similar to [1]. Then, I want to adapt that to do
transformations. What approach are you using? Maybe I can somehow steal
your work... ;)
