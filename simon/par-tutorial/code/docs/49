Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Setting up cabal on EC2
Message-ID: <BANLkTimY_R7GFE2dTB5qjJAeJ6w4uJMkiw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all.

I'm having some issues setting up cabal on EC2.

I've installed ghc 7.0.2, however, the bootstrap.sh script for
cabal-install is complaining about missing dependencies:

> Linking Setup ...
> Configuring Cabal-1.8.0.2...
> Setup: At least the following dependencies are missing:
> base >=4 && <3 && >=1 && <5, filepath >=1 && <1.2
> Setup: At least the following dependencies are missing: base >=4 && <3 && >=1 && <5, filepath >=1 && <1.2

ghc-pkg tells me that I have base and filepath installed:

> /usr/local/lib/ghc-7.0.2/package.conf.d
>    base-4.3.1.0

> /usr/local/lib/ghc-7.0.2/package.conf.d
>    filepath-1.2.0.0

Could there be an environment variable I need to set somewhere?
