System.Directory.getCurrentDirectory does not solve the problem.
System.Directory.getCurrentDirectory returns the directory *from which* the
program was called, also called "working directory".
The directory *from which* the program was called is not the same that the
directory *where the program executable is*, which my program needs to know.
For example:
/opt/myApp/test/myProg  - is a program
One may call it in many ways:
1)
cd /opt/myApp/test/
./myProg
Current or working directory: ./

or:

2)
cd /usr/local
/opt/myApp/test/myProg
Current or working directory: /usr/local

On the contrary, standard shell variable $0 - contains a full path to the
program location in the directory structure, no matter from what directory
the program was called.

How to find this path using GHC libraries?
