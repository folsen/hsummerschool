FYI: It's usually good to CC the package maintainer when a build fails
for non-trivial reasons.

At first glance it seems the SSH package was released when version 0.3
of the ASN package was current.  The ASN package is now on version 0.5
- so you can either add that constraint into the SSH package and try
again or fix the SSH package to work with ASN 0.5 and send in a patch
if that proves to be the case.

Cheers,
Thomas

P.S. It does appear that the ASN changes break this, but when I add
the version constraint I see that SSH implicitly uses
FlexibleInstances, which must be made explicit in GHC 7 via a LANGUAGE
pragma or equivalent.
