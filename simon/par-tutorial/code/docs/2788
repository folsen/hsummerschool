FWIW, if you generate these bindings with a tool (e.g. hsc2hs, c2hs),  
then there are standard machine-generated translations, which follow  
simple rules (so are easy to guess) and being mechanical, are always  
spelled as expected.  For example

     aLARM_STUFF_WENT_WRONG

for a constant Haskell Int value corresponding to the C enum or CPP  
constant.
