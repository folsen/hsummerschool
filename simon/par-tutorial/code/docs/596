Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Question about the Monad instance for Iteratee
 (from the enumerator package)

John Lato's "iteratee" package is based on IterateeMCPS.hs[1]. I used 
IterateeM.hs for "enumerator", because when I benchmarked them the non-CPS 
version was something like 10% faster on most operations.

The new IterateeM.hs solves some problems with the old encoding, but I 
haven't switched "enumerator" to it yet because it would break backwards 
compatibility.
