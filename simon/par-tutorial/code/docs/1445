That'd be expected; you shouldn't simply obliterate package.conf.d, you need
to keep ghc's boot libraries (which include itself as a library).  If the
boot libraries are somehow hosed, you need to reinstall the compiler to get
them back.

Although, I think you were headed there anyway:  template-haskell is a boot
library, since it's very tightly bound to the exact compiler version, so
it's almost always wrong to install it in any way other than as part of
installing GHC itself.
