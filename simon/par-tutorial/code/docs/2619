Subject: [Haskell-cafe] How to #include into .lhs files?
Message-ID: <AANLkTinGuuGe2ihAUZGTkLM+scGYLVp14iXBhU-toA1O@mail.gmail.com>

Does anyone have a working example of #include'ing Haskell code into a
bird-tracks-style .lhs file with GHC? Every way I try leads to parsing
errors. Is there documentation about how it's supposed to work?

Help much appreciated.   - Conal
