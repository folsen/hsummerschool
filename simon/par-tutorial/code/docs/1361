Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Haddock chokes on function arguments
Message-ID: <CAL4zPapf=s7un01+J2JnCaaTgm991bAHntXtRbcfzh-RuEoQOw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,
while trying to generate Haddock documentation (Haddock version 2.9.2, (c)
Simon Marlow 2006), it chokes on the following fragment

-- |Apply a given function over all elements of a list and select one of the
-- results.
selector :: (Arbitrary b) =>
            [a]      -> -- ^ Elements to select from
            (a -> b) -> -- ^ Constructor to apply to selected element
            Gen b
selector list ctor = oneof (map (return . ctor) list)

with the following error message:

'   parse error on input `-- ^ Elements to select from

I am puzzled as this is exactly how arguments are supposed to be documented,
according to http://www.haskell.org/haddock/doc/html/ch03s02.html#id565220

Any clues ?

Arnaud
