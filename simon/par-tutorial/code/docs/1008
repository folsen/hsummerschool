Yep, this is Apple's problem and everyone else just has to put up with it.

If you want to mix macports and a non-macports ghc, I think the best
solution is to self-compile ghc against the macports libiconv.  This
is easy, just configure ghc with

./configure --with-iconv-includes=/opt/local/include
--with-iconv-libraries=/opt/local/lib

I haven't had a problem since I started building ghc this way (10.5 and 10.6).
