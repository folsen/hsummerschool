G. Hillebrand, P. C. Kanellakis (in paper "Functional Database Query Languages as Typed Lambda Calculi of Fixed Order" and others) encoded tuples, lists, tables, the relational algebra, complex objects, and others in typed lambda calculus. The different things (I guess we can call them types here) were able to be compared with the uniformed (opeartional) semantics.
