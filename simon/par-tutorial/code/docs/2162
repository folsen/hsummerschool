Subject: [Haskell-cafe] OOM when linking, increasingly a problem
Message-ID: <20111221060645.GB3364@ohann>

I've started to run out of memory when linking certain packages.  The
culprits at the moment are crypto-api (Crypto.CPoly) and
Agda-executable.

A bit of searching revealed that adding

    ghc-options: -dynamic

to the Agda-executable .cabal could allow me to link that package.
And it worked.

crypto-api is a library package, so I some similar trick isn't really
a possibility there :(  Is there anything I can do about this?

System: Linux (ArchLinux)
GHC version: 7.0.3

Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with
millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural
integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.
