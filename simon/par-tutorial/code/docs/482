Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Confusing performance variation while optimising a
	tight loop
Message-ID: <1303202358.7914.1442758705@webmail.messagingengine.com>

Hello all,

I've been trying to improve the performance of Hemkay, my MOD player.
The mixing routines are in a separate library with no special
dependencies. Most of the time is spent in a small loop in the
mixToBuffer function [1] (note that this version is not the master
branch in case you give it a try). Each iteration does the following: it
advances a pointer in a waveform (float vector) with a fractional amount
(depending on the frequency at which it's played back), multiplies it by
the desired volume and distributes it over the two channels (two more
multiplication). The case where the step is less than zero is special
cased for efficiency (lines 170-183), but commenting that out won't
affect the output, just make it take about 15% more time. The isEmpty
and stepWave' functions come from the Music module.

The confusion is the following: a waveform can be of three kinds (empty,
single-shot or looped), which is represented by a plain sum type. In the
fastest version I match this pattern twice for every sample output
(through the isEmpty and stepWave' functions). Since the kind of
waveform doesn't change during this tight loop, I figured I could speed
it up by moving the pattern match out of the loop and only increasing
the index into the vector, thereby doing strictly less work per sample.
This is the version on lines 204-234. However, this modification makes
the program twice as slow as the original, and I simply don't understand
what I'm doing wrong or what could possibly cause this!

The speed test is a self-contained program in the test directory, you
can compile it after installing the library. If you pass it a MOD music
file, it'll perform mixing and quit immediately afterwards.
