Firstly, the checking-localhost-code in Yackage *is* broken for IPv6. I've
just pushed some changes to Warp to make the situation a little better for
specifying listening hosts, but that's not coming out most likely until Warp
0.4.

However, it doesn't sound like your problem is caused by the mis-behaving
Yackage code: it *should* give you a "permission denied" error message. Does
the connection work if you just run yackage normally, i.e. without -l?
