it does not seem to be related to literate haskell, if I copy the code
from your file into a .hs without the "> ", ghci still does not activate
the OverloadedStrings extension when loading the file.

I?d consider this a bug until the developers explain why this should or
cannot be different, and suggest you file it as such.
