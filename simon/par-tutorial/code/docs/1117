Anything useful has to be modified to depend on SemiGroup as well to get
mconcat or its replacement; that's why you jumped the proposal to begin
with....  As others have noted, this is a rather intrusive change to the
Haskell ecosystem.

*If* it has in fact been decided to go ahead with it, *then* this proposal
should be merged with yours since the best time to do it is when mconcat is
being relocated anyway.  I don't think we've made it past the "if",
especially given the comments so far.
