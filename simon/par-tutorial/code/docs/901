In addition to the excellent reasons that Mark outlined, there is another important reason to *not* include gcc and friends in the HP.  Every software developer (as opposed to friend of a friend who just wanted to try to learn programming with Haskell on a road trip) will already have Xcode installed on their Mac.

Having two versions of gcc, make, lots of other tools, library headers, library objects, etc is going to lead to subtle bugs and headaches; at the latest, when you compile your first multi-language project.  (This is where this is not comparable to the situation on Windows with mingw.  A software developer on Windows, will have Visual Studio installed, but usually not some flavour of the GNU tools.)

PS: I am sure there is demand for a self-contained, lightweight beginners/teaching Haskell environment, but let's not confuse that with the main distribution.
