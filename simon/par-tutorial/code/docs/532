Many packages have the combinator named enumPair (or something like
that). Here is one example
	http://okmij.org/ftp/ftp/Streams.html#1enum2iter
The combinator is quite useful for logging, for dumping the contents
of the stream as it is being processed.

You need enumeratees, which convert one stream into another. There are
many examples of those: e.g., converting a stream of bytes into a stream
of lines, or a stream of compressed/encoded data into the plaintext
stream. You enumerator package probably has them. The Stream.html page
also describes many examples of enumeratees.
