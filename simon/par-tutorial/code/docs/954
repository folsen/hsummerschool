Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANN: Netwire AFRP library
Message-ID: <20110807165627.54ddd760@angst.streitmacht.eu>

Hi there,

after a few weeks of development time, I have released the first
official version of my arrowized FRP library called Netwire:

    http://hackage.haskell.org/package/netwire

I have written it with networking applications in mind, but it is a
general purpose library, so it can be used in all of the classic fields
like gaming, animation, user interfaces and others.

Its basic idea is the same as in Yampa, but its internal structure is
much simpler and hence it's easier to extend.  Also like in most of my
libraries I have specifically decided to expose the internals, so you
can extend Netwire without having to fork.

Features not found in Yampa/Animas:

  * switching by ArrowChoice,
  * suspended signal transformers,
  * signal inhibition,
  * combination through ArrowZero and ArrowPlus,
  * impure signal transformers.

There exists a wiki page, which should give you a quickstart:

    http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Netwire

I would be grateful for any constructive feedback.


Greets,
Ertugrul
