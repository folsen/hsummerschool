Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Distributions link on Hackage
Message-ID: <87obzwm57o.fsf@write-only.cryp.to>

Hi,

the home page of a package on Hackage links to various distributions to
show which versions are available, i.e. Fedora, Debian, FreeBSD, etc. In
NixOS, we have fairly up-to-date package set, and I would like to see
that distribution included on Hackage.

Now I wonder how to get that done? Can anyone advice on the procedure to
add support for a distribution to Hackage?

Take care,
Peter
