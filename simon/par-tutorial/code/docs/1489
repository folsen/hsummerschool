A web server should not be setting "Content-encoding: gzip" on a
.tar.gz file. I agree that http-enumerator is correctly following the
spec by decompressing.

If you decide to implement a workaround for this, the only reasonable
thing I can think of is adding a "ignoreContentEncoding" knob the user
can twiddle to violate spec.
