Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Complete package description list
Message-ID: <CABG-yt094g5_Q4ZQh9+B9drQi4os+Wqm7O1t2TMkYyXDbTwvMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I would like to know:

1. The correct source to get the complete list of available Haskell
package descriptions
2. Any feed or notification mechanism to get newer updates on packages

How often does the 00-index.tar.gz file from:

  http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/00-index.tar.gz

get updated? Or if there is a newer version, where is it made available?

Given 00-index.tar.gz, and using the following RSS feed:

  http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/recent.rss

give me the complete list of available packages?

Appreciate any suggestions in this regard,

Thanks!

SK
