Hi Ertugrul,

That would seem to make sense, if there is appropriate terminology.

And if we are indeed talking about co-routines, i.e. cooperation
between peers, routines of equal status, that would in itself suggest
that the X-or and X-ee names that imply an asymmetric relationship
are somewhat unfortunate choices conveying the wrong intuition.

Best,
