You can run gdb on a Haskell program, but it's unlikely you'll learn
anything useful unless you're a compiler writer trying to debug your
compiler or runtime system.

ghci (the interactive version of GHC) has a built-in debugger that may
be the closest thing to what you're used to with gdb. There is also a
small cottage industry of debuggers that are more tailored to the
process of debugging a functional program.

Cheers,
Tim
