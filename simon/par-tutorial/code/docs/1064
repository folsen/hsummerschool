Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Building ? using kleene closure {not haskell
	specific}
Message-ID: <CAGdT1goYBsA=9WbXH57T9=ps9tZHX8pqWbiFRo4ZiKW-gg1=Ww@mail.gmail.com>

Hello gentle Haskell folks,

I happened to read "Beautiful code"'s chapter 1 today and found Brian
Kerninghan's regex implementation. In it he only shows the * meta character.
I can easily understand how + can be built but am having trouble with
building ? (zero or one). I'd really appreciate it if some one could help me
understand it.

Regards,
Kashyap
