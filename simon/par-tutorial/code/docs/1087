Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Diffs for hackage
Message-ID: <CALqQuoi88Uk7GF3QeFSxBwzYybc6w69h4sxPGmk_HjbKgyhbTg@mail.gmail.com>

hi all,

often when a new version of a package is available on hackage, I want to see
what has changed since the previous release. Unfortunately many packages
don't have a changelog or a public source code repository. That's why I have
made a simple website with git repositories that contain all versions of all
hackage packages:

http://hdiff.luite.com/

The home page contains a bookmarklet that takes you directly from the index
page of a package version (for example
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec-3.1.0 ) to the commit diff,
showing the difference with the previous version (
http://hdiff.luite.com/cgit/parsec/commit?id=3.1.0 )

I hope some people will find this useful,

luite
