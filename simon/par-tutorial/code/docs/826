Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Iteratee: manyToOne
Message-ID: <BANLkTinwOoNcVGx1awFANAywZUyxnUpWPg@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

does somewhere exist function with type like this - manyToOne :: [Iteratee a
m b] -> Iteratee a m [b] ?

I.e. I need to process one input through many Iteratees indepentently in
constant space and collect results.

It is similar by type with sequenceM but as far as I understand sequenceM
won't use the same input for all Iteratees.
