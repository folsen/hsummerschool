Right. It can still be tricky. I think we can get rid of a large
number of strictness issues by using strict data structures more
often, this should help beginners in particular. For the rest better
tooling would help. For example, a lint tool that marked up code with
the strictness information inferred by the compiler would be useful. I
had time to write one I would make the output look like HPC html
reports, with one color for strict function arguments and one color
for lazy function arguments.
