In my experience (as an application writer) it is very useful; it's just
a different paradigm, not a weaker one. Off-hand I don't remember a case
where having mandatory locking would have improved things.

Me neither - I just wanted to point out that your email sounded _too_
eager to blame the current state of affairs on the fact that Linux
doesn't support proper locking. Whereas, the problem is just one of
taking into account platform differences better.
