Subject: [Haskell-cafe] GHCI Feature Request: Last Successful Compilation
	State Saved
Message-ID: <CAJrReygxTo_DVA6B4bNozP0WR+_X7ZqQs=ERdHhuXKJNc-3+0A@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,
I would like for the GHCI interpreter to save its environment before
reloading a file and allowed the user to revert back to that state if the
compilation was unsuccessful.

Many times I've changed files, loaded them, hit a compilation error and
needed, for example, the inferred type signature of some function. Even
though that function hasn't been changed I have to either fix my code, undo
a bunch of changes or comment out the last change I made and reload in order
to do a ":type" on the function. This really breaks the flow of development.


Thanks for considering.
