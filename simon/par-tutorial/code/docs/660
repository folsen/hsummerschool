I also found the introduction about 'darcs' being too academic quite 
silly. However at the end of his invited rant Linus proposes a requirement 
(or may we call it 'axiom'?), that would be nice to be have: An identifier 
(a 'version') that can be uniquely mapped to a set of files and their 
contents. In Darcs this is the darcs history and it is usually the largest 
part of submitted darcs patches.
