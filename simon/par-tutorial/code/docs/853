Subject: [Haskell-cafe] How to make ghc 7 with llvm?
Message-ID: <BANLkTim17m2=ymk-f-ZcKQKbwF_Z5z=4Xg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
  As I recalled, ghc started to support llvm from version 7.
  But there is a problem: there is no option to make ghc with llvm. So
Library within ghc source will be in gcc's binary format. Then when I
install other packages, they may complain that the binary format is
not llvm, so they install some libraries again.
  Any way I could make ghc 7 with llvm?
