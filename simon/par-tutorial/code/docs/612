Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANN: Leksah 0.10.0
Message-ID: <B679E9AB-F616-48E0-94B7-74D3EDEACD79@googlemail.com>

Yesterday we uploaded our official 0.10.0 release (0.10.0.4) to Hackage
and we have Windows and OS X installers at http://leksah.org/download.html

Anyone using an earlier version should upgrade.

This release is mainly small improvements and bug fixes.  Some of the
improvements include:

* Better messages for some common problems.
* Improved grep (now searches all source directories in your workspace)
* Updated build system for more reliable rebuilding of dependent
  packages in your workspace

We have automated the building of the Leksah installers and this should
allow us to do more frequent releases in the future.

There is a lot more to do and we would love to hear from anyone who has
time to help out.

Worth mentioning because they can be hard to find:

* <Ctrl> R adds missing imports
* <Ctrl> <Enter> evaluates current line or selection in GHCi 
* Right click menu in the editor has other debug functions
* Comment and uncomment are now <Ctrl> D and <Ctrl> <Shift> D

To build Leksah yourself:

* Install Gtk and GtkSourceView2 (C libraries and headers)
* Install The Haskell Platform (or GHC >= 6.12.3)
* cabal update
* cabal install gtk2hs-buildtools
* cabal install leksah  
* leksah

Making a Gtk application look nice on Windows and OS X is not easy so
we recommend using one of these prebuilt binaries:

Windows users using GHC 7.0.3
http://leksah.org/packages/leksah-0.10.0.4-ghc-7.0.3.exe

Windows users using GHC 6.12.3
http://leksah.org/packages/leksah-0.10.0.4-ghc-6.12.3.exe

OS X 10.6 users using GHC 7.0.3
http://leksah.org/packages/leksah-0.8.0.6.dmg

(These installers do not install Gtk2Hs packages on your system)

Please consult http://leksah.org/download.html for more details about
installation! Background information can be found in the Leksah manual
http://leksah.org/leksah_manual.pdf.

Known bugs and problems:

* Leksah does not run with GHC 6.12.2

Have fun
