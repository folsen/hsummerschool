On the one hand, the Cabal user's guide is a little out of date.
More importantly, there's a difference between the Cabal library and the 
'cabal' executable (which you get from the cabal-install package).
The Cabal user's guide can't assume that you have the cabal executable, but 
it can assume you have runhaskell (since without a Haskell implementation, 
installing Haskell libraries is doomed to fail anyway).
However, if the user's guide gets updated, the cabal way will probably (and 
definitely should) be added.
