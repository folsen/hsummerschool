Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: Save the date! Haskell hackathon in
 Philadelphia, July 29-31
Message-ID: <20110212205417.GA30037@seas.upenn.edu>

I am very pleased to announce that Hac phi 3, third in an annual
series of Haskell hackathons hosted at the University of Pennsylvania
in Philadelphia, will take place from July 29-31.  More details will
be forthcoming, but put it on your calendar now.  The past two years
have been a blast -- you won't want to miss this one!  


Q: Do I have to already be a Haskell expert to attend?

A: No!  All are welcome.  In fact, sitting in a room with a bunch of
   enthusiastic Haskell hackers is a great way to learn.  Past
   attendees have included seasoned Haskell gurus and raw beginners
   alike.

Q: What does one do at a Haskell hackathon?

A: The goal is to create a fun, interactive, collaborative environment
   for writing Haskell code.  You can work on a project of your own,
   or help someone else with theirs.

Q: What will the cost be?

A: We're still working out the details, but as in past years,
   registration will be free, and we hope to be able to provide some
   of the meals.  You'll be on your own for transportation and
   lodging.
