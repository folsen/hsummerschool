I've used 'haskell-src' to generate code, but thankfully I didn't need
to include any CPP.

I've wanted to experiment with using haskell-src-exts to generate code
with Haddocks, but it looks like it will be painful, since it doesn't
include comments in the syntax tree proper. This is appropriate for
arbitrary comments, but Haddocks can only appear in specific locations
(I think?).

Here is a utility module I use as a wrapper around haskell-src to make
it a bit friendlier for generating modules:

http://code.haskell.org/~aslatter/code/xhb/build-utils/src/HaskellCombinators.hs

Maybe you can add an 'OtherCall String' calling convention to haskell-src-exts?

I'm not sure what to do about comments.
