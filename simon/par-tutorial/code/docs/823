Still a lot short of ten years ;)

Yes, version 0.8.0.5. I don't expect the version to matter much, but it 
could make a difference.

I ran
$ leksah-server -e DEBUG -s
to locate the problem, that reported that it couldn't retrieve metadata, 
then "inGhcIO called with []", Start: ("ghc", ["--print-libdir"]), success 
report (forgot how that was worded), End: ("ghc", ["--print-libdir"]).

After that, no more, so I added some more debugM calls to the server code. 
Printing the package description,

    liftIO $ debugM "leksah-server" $ "Description: " ++ show pd
    deepseq pd (return pd)

hung at Statistics.Function.partialSort, getting as far as

   dscMbTypeStr'  = Just "

Awesome.

Yup, can reach it again.
