Subject: [Haskell-cafe] fyi GHC 7.2.1 release on the benchmarks game
Message-ID: <1313162290.59789.YahooMailClassic@web65615.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>

1) Some of the GHC programs contributed to the benchmarks game have problems with recent GHC releases

- meteor-contest #5 - Ambiguous occurrence `permutations'

http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=meteor&lang=ghc&id=5#log


- regex-dna #2 - Precedence parsing error

http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=regexdna&lang=ghc&id=2#log


- reverse-complement #2 - parse error on input `->'

http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=revcomp&lang=ghc&id=2#log


- reverse-complement #3 - Could not find module `Monad'

http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64q/program.php?test=revcomp&lang=ghc&id=3#log


2) I noticed `-fvia-C` has now gone away and there were half-a-dozen programs that had been written to use `-fvia-C` so how might that effect performance of those programs?
