Omit the words "least restrictive" and I think you are correct.

To combine licences, just aggregate them.  There is no lattice of  
subsumption; no "more" or "less" restrictive ordering.  It's simple:  
you must obey all of them.  Some aggregations introduce a  
contradiction of terms, so you cannot legally aggregate those modules  
without breaking some term.  But if the terms of the aggregated  
licences are compatible rather than contradictory, then all is good.
