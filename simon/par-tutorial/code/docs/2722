http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/haskell-cafe/2011-February/088829.html

Short version: community.haskell.org was hacked.  Admins quickly
shifted it to a new server ahead of schedule (since if they were going
to do a fix/update they might as well do it on a new machine).  Some
stuff is up, but the various logins, etc. aren't for security reasons,
etc.
