This is not how I work.  I have source open in one window, and switch
between files with keybindings for tags, search in same directory,
search in recent buffers, switch between test and non-test module,
etc. (and to the guy who likes how files open != buffers shown, yes
vim does this too).  ghci is open in the other window.  :L loads the
currently edited module into ghci.  Then I edit and :r to typecheck or
test a function by hand.  Or I switch to the test module and run the
test interactively until it passes.  I have a number of other
shortcuts to insert a type signature, automatically add and remove
'import' lines, exchange argument order, etc., but these few simple
things already work pretty well.  It also helps to have a tiling
window manager and switch focus with the keyboard.
