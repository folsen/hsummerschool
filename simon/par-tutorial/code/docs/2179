SciTE's default binding /is/ proportional, not mono-space. I find it 
ever so irritating. Then again, I'm sure this one comes squarely down to 
personal preference, so it seems pointless to debate it.

LaTeX offers the possibility of mid-line alignment even if you don't use 
monospace - a feature which I haven't seen in any other text processing 
system. It's a pitty this isn't more widespread...
