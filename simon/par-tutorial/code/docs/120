Presumably because this will use less disk space on average.

I too don't see any reason to forbid other Unicode encodings. Perhaps
mandate support for UTF-8, and allow others with a pragma. But unless
someone adds support to a Haskell compiler for such a pragma, it will be
fairly pointless putting this in the standard.
