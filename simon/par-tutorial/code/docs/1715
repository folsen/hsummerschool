Whoohoo, good to hear!  I've always written those links in my docs,
under the hope that they would some day start working :)

Well, it could look at the filesystem and tell them apart, right?  I
suppose you're right, it's ambiguous if there's both Data.hs:data List
= ... and Data/List.hs.

I guess what really trips me up is that ""s "blink link" feature means
it will try to turn all sorts of improbably things into module links.
It might be enough to check for Camel.Dots.Words to reduce the amount
of manual " quoting you have to do.
