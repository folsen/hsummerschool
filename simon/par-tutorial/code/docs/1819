Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: Anansi 0.4.2 (literate programming
	pre-processor)
Message-ID: <CAL1ky9qKan_3QxOv291H4q8wuCdXwbEeLv4hS5EDBssina12Ww@mail.gmail.com>

Anansi is a preprocessor for literate programs, in the model of NoWeb
or nuweb. Literate programming allows both computer code and
documentation to be generated from a single unified source.

Hackage: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/anansi-0.4.2

-----

This release has a couple cool new features, suggested by Dirk Laurie.

Markdown loom
===============

Markdown, a lightweight markup language similar to ReStructuredText,
is used often on web forums. Use [[ :loom anansi.markdown ]] in your
documents to enable.

User-defined line pragmas
========================

Users can now add, modify, and disable line pragmas in tangled output
based on file extension. This makes it much easier to combine code and
data in a single source file. By default, line pragmas are enabled for
the C, C++, C#, Haskell, Perl, and Go languages.

Customizing the pragma format is easy. Use the ${line}, ${path}, and
${quoted-path} substitutions in an :option. This example code will
insert comments into tangled Python code:

-------------------------------------------
:# Insert comments into any tangled output file with a name ending in ".py"
:option anansi.line-pragma-py=# Generated from ${path} line ${line}
-------------------------------------------

To disable line pragmas for a particular file type, just set its
pragma format to an empty string:
-------------------------------------------
:option anansi.line-pragma-pl=
-------------------------------------------
