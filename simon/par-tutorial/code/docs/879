My guess is that you're doing all indexing work inside a single GHC
API session.  When loading external packages GHC caches all .hi files
in memory -- and never unloads them.   Therefore, if you have a large
package DB, that'll consume a lot of memory.  For similar reasons you
can also run into problems with redefined instances if you happen to
process two packages that define the same instances because they too
are cached and never flushed.

The workaround is to start multiple sessions and then combine the
resulting output.

I don't know how much of a problem the Haddock + TH issue is that
David mentioned.  In any case you should make sure that haddock can
see the installed packages so it doesn't need to compile any
dependencies for TH.
