I'm glad it's not just me. Any danger of this being fixed someday?

I notice that there's duplicate reports of the HTML documentation in the 
Haskell Platform having chunks missing, and yet both HP 2011.2.0.0 and 
HP 2011.2.0.1 still have this exact same problem. I thought the purpose 
of filing a bug report was to get things fixed?
