Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Is Hugs dead?
Message-ID: <1303474568.13029.4.camel@fuzxxl>

Some weeks ago, I mirrored the hugs repo to github.
(https://github.com/fuzxxl/Hugs) This was, when I found out, that the
last commit was about 2 years ago. Also, since some of the dependencies
moved, I was unable to build hugs.

Now my question is: Is Hugs dead? What's the status of development of
hugs?

Yours, Robert Clausecker
