Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Error in the asynchronous exception operational
	semantics
Message-ID: <1312922260-sup-2735@ezyang>

Hello all,

I was recently reading "Asynchronous Exceptions as an Effect" by Harrison,
Allwein, Gill and Procter, and noticed at the end that they found an error
in the operational semantics described in "Asynchronous Exceptions in Haskell"
by the Simons and Andrew Moran.  Does anyone know what this error was, and
whether or not it was corrected in the December 12, 2006 version of the paper
floating around on the net?

Thanks,
Edward
