Based on your feedback I used the GTK+ rc styling system to set the
colors for the background of the bar and the default text color.
Right now it ignores your GTK theme, but you can also customize it as
described here:

Let me know if that works a bit better for you - I played around with
it a little bit and it seems to work with various themes and gives
some reasonable customizability.

This is in v0.1.2 up on hackage
