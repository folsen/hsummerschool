The one on the list is not a mathematical symbol. It should be ? STAR OPERATOR U+22C6 or ? ASTERISK OPERATOR U+2217.

If you can convince the Unicode Consortium to add a lambda that is of class symbol, Haskell can then make use of it ? once there are fonts that support it.  

There is
  http://www.stixfonts.org/
For typesetting with Xe[La]TeX or Lua[La]TeX, use XITS (in the TeXLive package).

This is the big problem right now: how to enter these symbols efficiently.
