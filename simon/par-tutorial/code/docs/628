Subject: [Haskell-cafe] fishing for ST mutable Vector examples
Message-ID: <liliz22nuw.fsf@inside.sv3.smugmug.net>

hi all

i was wondering if anyone could post some minimal examples on using
mutable Vectors in the ST monad. i've been digging around in the usual
places but haven't been able to find anything to get me over the hump

thanks in advance
brad
