There's a tar-ball served from
http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/hackage.html
(http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/archive.tar) which
contains the latest version of all packages.  I think that's what the
OP is using.  Downloading a 150MB tar-ball shouldn't take many hours,
if you're on a decent connection.
