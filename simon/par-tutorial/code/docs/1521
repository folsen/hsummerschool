In #haskell, we came up with the idea of running two instances of ghci. 
Try loading in one instance first; if good, commit to the other instance 
too; if bad, you still have the other instance in a functional state. 
Presumably, this should be automated by some middleware.

(We were discussing the prospect of auto-reload, i.e., automatically 
poll source file timestamps and reload.)
