I've checked in the cabal file - I am not familiar with it though ... how
exactly can I use it to build the project?

Also, do you have an idea how it can be incorporated into GHCI - As in, the
program should do a forkIO and in one thread, handle network and on the
other prompt an interactive ghci shell that'll let one modify the screen
buffer in an expressive way in haskell!
