Subject: [Haskell-cafe] AES on 32-bit system
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=BQsuAF-Hmp94n6NqKU_P_rrv+17_rfVHVkpo7@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

Does anyone else have trouble installing the AES package on a 32-bit
system? My system at home installs it just fine, but my VPS chokes
with the following error messages (plus a bunch of warnings):

cbits/ctr_inc.c:11:0:
     error: 'uint_64t' undeclared (first use in this function)

cbits/ctr_inc.c:11:0:
     error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once

cbits/ctr_inc.c:11:0:  error: for each function it appears in.)

cbits/ctr_inc.c:11:0:
     error: 'ctr' undeclared (first use in this function)

cbits/ctr_inc.c:11:0:  error: expected expression before ')' token

It's actually for this very reason that I'm still maintaining the
OpenSSL backend for http-enumerator: I think the tls package is stable
enough now to be used in production environments (kudos to Vincent by
the way). However, I can't use it in production if I can't build one
of its dependencies. This bug is also preventing me from adding some
nice features to http-enumerator, such as checking validity of SSL
certificates.

Anyone have any thoughts?

Michael
