With all my respect:
I think I know several mathematicians who learning that a person asking 
for help begins with trying to distinguish  between knowledgeable, and 
those who just think they are, will simply - to say it politely - refuse 
to engage.
(There might be some impolite answers as well, but you don't need the 
details).
