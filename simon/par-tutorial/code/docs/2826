Hi Lee,
I would also guess that these are probably the implementations of equality
in the given modules.

One way to test this would be to name the equality function explicitly.  For
example, something like this:

myEquality x y = ...
instance Eq MyType where (==) = myEquality

Another option would be to look at the generated core by using -ddump-simpl
when compiling. This will generate a whole bunch of output, which you can
redirect to a file and the search for the mysterious symbols inside.

Hope this helps,
-Iavor
