Subject: [Haskell-cafe] GSoC Proposal: A 3d visualization of code (packages)

Dear Haskell Programmers,

To get some feedback on my proposal here is posting that explains it 
more detailed:
http://tillmannvogt.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/gsoc/

If this succeeds it could become the poster child application for WebGL 
and there will be an immediate value to all Haskell programmers: Get an 
overview what is happening. In the long term there is the possibility to 
have a very powerful UI-library and to be able to combine visualizations 
with Code.

The milestone plan is just to show that it should be doable. The part 
that is not so clear how to do is the integration with hackage2. It 
could even be a separate site like haskellers.com that links to various 
resources. Should a WebGL engine be used (then it should be easy to load 
a collada file) or can WebGL be integrated in a haskell web framework?
