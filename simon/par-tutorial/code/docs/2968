Hello.

How do I make ghc use my installation of MinGW on Windows? I have
ghc-7.0.1 installed and the latest MinGW packages. I want ghc to
automatically find libraries installed by the MinGW installer.

Currently I am getting the error with my application:

Linking Gui.exe ...
C:\Program Files\Haskell\iconv-0.4.1.0\ghc-7.0.1/libHSiconv-0.4.1.0.a(hsiconv.o):hsiconv.c:(.text+0x8): undefined reference to `libiconv_open'

where libiconv has been installed with the command

mingw-get install mingw32-libiconv

and the library is available at c:/devel/MinGW/lib/
