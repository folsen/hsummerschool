I'm gonna clarify my point a little ^^.

In fact pedantry was involved. The way Albert started his original post was
pedantic.
The scaring effect was mostly caused by such discourse showing two things:
- Haskellers make use of obscure terms and distinctions (e.g. "denotational
semantics")
- ...whose meaning does not make a consensus amongst Haskellers *themselves*
!
Seeing that from an outsider point of view kind of makes you think: "OMG,
what are those hairy guys inventing weird concepts they're not even capable
to agree upon!" ^^

And to prove my second post -- as I expected -- has come someone (MigMit)
to question Albert's statements.

Plus no one is really stating clearly at which level the terms "eager",
"strict" and "lazy" should be involved (for instance in Haskell's
specification or in GHC's implementation).
