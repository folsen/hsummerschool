Since LinkedIn tends to spam even more ambitiously than the other social
network sites, I have a procmail rule sending any mail from Linkedin to
/dev/null.  But it doesn't work when it's sent via other mailing lists,
when some person of dubious faculty and questionable morals wants to add
an entire list to his "professional network"...
