Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Haskell Summers of Code retrospective (updated for
	2011)
Message-ID: <CAMwO0gzH_FydogGopsE_J6t5SUrZSOjUc=CjZHHdpc8rAr2RWg@mail.gmail.com>

The Wheel turns, and months come and pass, leaving blog posts that
fade into 404s; a wind rose in Mountain View, whispering of the coming
Winter...

Tonight I sat down and finally looked into the 2011 SoCs to see how
they turned out and judge them according to my whimsically arbitrary
and subjective standards:

They turned out pretty much as I predicted - but then I *would* say
that, wouldn't I?
