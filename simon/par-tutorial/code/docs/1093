Hi,

this is something that should be changed! Reviewing code changes to see
what has changed may be ok if you upgrade one library that you are going
to use the library extensively. But for Distribution packagers (and
surely other use cases), it is just too much.

See http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/299 for more
discussion, but please, avoid overengineering and rather get us
changelogs soon.

Maybe it would already help to add a "changelog-file" field to .cabal,
just as with license-file, and reject packages on hackage that do not
have this field and file, and later decide if we need a more
standardized format for changelogs.

Greetings,
Joachim
