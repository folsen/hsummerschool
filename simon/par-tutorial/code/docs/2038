That was the point of my post.

If you're actually confronted with this perception that traffic accidents 
are relevant to project success, you're already in deep manure because 
there's so much more than code in a project. That's what you need to 
explain.

Code is the "means" of getting us to an "end". It seems these people are 
worring about the "means" when the big problem is actually conveying the 
"ends".

(Again, just my take on the situation, I'm not claiming canonicity or 
anything.)
