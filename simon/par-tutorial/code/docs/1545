You might be right.
You may be dead wrong... Some people like to teach, find some pleasure 
in explaining things they know, and find a pleasure in trying to be 
useful. But they might refuse, if they hear:
  "...if you are a real specialist and you know what you are talking 
about, tell me what is better, the chi-square test or (...)".
Knuth admitted that he had learnt a lot while teaching things he already 
knew. So did Feynman. And Landau.

All the best.
