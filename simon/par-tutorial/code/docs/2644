Just out of curiosity, has anyone gotten this to work?  I'm getting bus errors whenever I call readImage.  

If anyone out there has gotten it working and would tell me which versions they're using of the relevant bits, that would be very much appreciated.  Also, I'll post all my debug info if there's someone who's gotten this to work.


thanks,
mc
