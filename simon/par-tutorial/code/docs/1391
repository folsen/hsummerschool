So it looks like you will have to recompile the base libraries with
-fPIC (or try this on Windows, where PIC is unnecessary).

The way I would do this personally is to recompile all of GHC, and in
mk/build.mk set the GhcLibHcOpts to -fPIC. There may be a way to just
recompile the base library (and dependents) using Cabal, but I'm less
sure about that path.

Note that using -fPIC will probably impose a performance penalty on
the library code.
