Hi Max --

I know that several people have used hsmagick successfully, but I
don't have Mac OS 10.6 (I use 10.5.8), so I can't try to reproduce
your problem.

Vincent Gerard is taking over maintainership of the library, so you
may want to cc him on any emails. In general it's not too safe to
assume that any particular library maintainer reads haskell-cafe
regularly :-)

Cheers,
Tim (hsmagick maintainer)
