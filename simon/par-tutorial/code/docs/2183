Monospace isn't used in math (except in the days when one used typewriters), but alignments are of course used in matrices and multiline formulas, for example, which may correspond to uses in computer code.

A problem is that LaTeX is used for rendering typeset pages, and not really suitable for writing direct computer code, though Unicode characters can improve the readability of LaTeX source code. The link below shows an example.
