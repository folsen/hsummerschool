Subject: [Haskell-cafe] why the name lambda calculus?
Message-ID: <CAGdT1gpjdu9+F6QOP0ULtrCS9JKyRT89ZorDf-2tOsavR1poOg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
Can someone please tell me what is the root of the name lambda calculus? Is
it just because of the symbol lambda that is used?
Why not alpha or beta calculus?
Regards,
Kashyap
