Seems to be the same page you're referring to, but no 2011.4 link.

Just in case, I forced a page refresh - and got a surprise when that 
fixed it.

OK - I really should have tried that before. But... why would an old 
page hang around in my Firefox cache so long and not get updated? I've 
not had this on any other sites.
