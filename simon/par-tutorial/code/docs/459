  From this I gather, one can not generally kill Haskell threads
  while they are in the midst of foreign calls. I guess
  interrupting execution to terminate the program is special
  since you don't expect anything to work properly afterward.

  It turns out the PGcancel exists for this purpose. Is it safe
  and reasonable to make query cancellation a ThreadKilled
  handler in the query thread?

  I gather I need to write the busy loop for polling for data in
  Haskell. Although libpq has a procedure -- PGgetResult -- that
  polls for data, it would not respond to killThread.
