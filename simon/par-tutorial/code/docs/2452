Subject: [Haskell-cafe] IO typeclasses
Message-ID: <CAJUDvcjp=y2Tx+vDYXcEVnXEdXD-_5A2fr=mEbN2ozsqjP-9Sw@mail.gmail.com>

Is there any particular reason IO functions in the standard libraries
aren't grouped into type-classes?

This might allow for:

1) Testing IO code without actual input and output. (I have done this on a
small scale, but it presently involves much ugliness).
2) Redirecting output of a function that neglects to take a handle without
a bunch of calls to dup.
3) Forwarding IO over a connection to a remote system, allowing code
written to work locally to be applied remotely, or vice-versa.
4) Wrapping dangerous IO actions in additional sanity checks.

Thoughts?
