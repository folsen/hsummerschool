Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Hackage down!
Message-ID: <CA+L91bOB+qMoSExJ_MOyV=eMp5yez1C5mtX43CCTb_W7wfCF9g@mail.gmail.com>

Hi everybody,

Is hackage.haskell.org down? I'm trying to access it but no answer, no ping
response (timeout) , nothing.
Is somebody else facing the same problem?

Cheers,
Edgar Gomes
