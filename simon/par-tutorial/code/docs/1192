The more fundamental problem is that splitting is neither well understood
nor generally safe, and as such it should not be in the basic Random class.
A more sensible API would have a Random class that lacks a split operation,
and a SplittableRandom class that permits it, as you mention later in your
message. Most current PRNGs could then be instances of Random, but not
SplittableRandom.

And I think we need splitting, especially as more Haskell programs become

I do not agree here, I'm afraid.

By the way, my mwc-random package is at least as fast as mersenne-twister,
has smaller state, and is pure Haskell.
