Usually the low level one is merely a thin layer, whereas the high level one
is more than just Haskell conventions but a proper Haskell-style API, using
e.g. monads instead of opaque state blobs.

+1.  The stuff that's a thin wrapper, such as System.Posix.*, should keep
names as close to the API it's mirroring as possible; if you want to rename
them, do it in the context of an actual Haskell API.
