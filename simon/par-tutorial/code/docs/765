Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: cereal-0.3.3.0
Message-ID: <4DB701A8.4000604@galois.com>

Hot on the heels of the last release, cereal-0.3.3.0 [1] adds support
for parsing and rendering lazy ByteStrings.  Most running functions in
Data.Serialize.Get and Data.Serialize.Put now have lazy analogues, and
Data.Serialize has gained encodeLazy and decodeLazy.

This new functionality was made possible by the incremental parsing
support added in cereal-0.3.1.0 by Lemmih.
