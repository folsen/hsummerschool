If you have the package tarball, you can unpack it manually
and then type "cabal install" (with no package name) inside that
directory.

You don't need to open the port. With the -l flag yackage
only uses the port on localhost. There are sometimes problems
with that in the latest version, but that will be fixed in the next
release.

But anyway, it sounds like you indeed may not need a server at all.
