Writing a plain Haskell module that contains the code that depends on 
the particular base-version?

Usually I try to stay away from this preprocessor hackery, and this case 
seems to support my attempts. What I do is to add Hs-Source-Dirs 
depending on some Cabal flag, and connect it with a field like 
Build-Depends: base==3.*.
