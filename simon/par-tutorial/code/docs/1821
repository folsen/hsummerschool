It looks like the function 'xmlParse' returns a value of type
'Document Posn', according to the API docs. I'm guessing the 'Posn'
value is used to annotate the position in the source document a
particular piece of XML came from, so you can report errors better.

Since the pretty-printing functions ignore it, you can replace it with
whatever you want, even with a value of a different type if you have a
need to annotate the tree.
