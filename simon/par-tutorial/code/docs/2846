Hi,

I have recently finished a paper about Froglingo, a programming language designed to make it easier to write data-intensive business applications. It is a monolith consolidating programming, database/file management, data exchange, web server, and access control. What makes Froglingo unique is a sub language that is the first known as semantically equivalent to a class of TOTAL recursive functions.
Froglingo shares with Haskell a declarative approach to programming, and strong mathematical foundations, so I thought that people on this list might find it of some interest. 

You can find the paper at: http://www.froglingo.com/FroglingoPL.pdf. If you have any thoughts about it, I?d love to hear from you.

Thank you for your attention.
Kevin
