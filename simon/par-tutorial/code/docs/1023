Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: Chell: A quiet test runner (low-output

--------

This is just a quick package I whipped up out of frustration with
test-framework scrolling an error message out of sight, for the
millionth time.

Chell has the same general purpose (aggregate your assertions +
properties + whatever into a single executable), but only prints when
a test fails or aborts.

It also has a small built-in test library, similar to HUnit, so you
don't need to depend on 2-3 separate libraries if you're just doing
simple tests. Cool features thereof:

* it reports the line number of failed assertions

* you can use $expect instead of $assert, so even if it fails, the
test keeps going (all the failures are printed at the end)

* you can add "notes" to a test, which are saved in logs and reports.
you can put in any sort of metadata you want (nice for figuring out
why a test is failing)

* assertions for text diffs, so if you're testing two big chunks of
text for equality you don't have to copy+paste to see what's
different.
