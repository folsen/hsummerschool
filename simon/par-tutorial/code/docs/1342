I didn't realize it linked to the slides; I thought that pointed to the
article. I just found another version of the paper, A Simple Implementation
Technique for Priority Search Queues, by Hinze, which shows the binding type
as a pair, with access functions for k and p. I'll continue to work my way
through the material there. Thanks for you response.
