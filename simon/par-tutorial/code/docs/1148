Glad you find it useful.  The color thing is bothering me a bit too.
I think I know how to fix it properly and hopefully I'll be able to in
the next day or two.

I should probably just not set any colors by default and follow the
default GTK theme.  Then I should be able to provide some hook to use
an alternate theme instead (something that lets you easily set text
and background colors).
