Wanting a general base case + specific exceptional cases is in no way
heinous. However this is somewhat at odds with type-class resolution
as it stands. SYB3 is a one of systems to reconcile the problem.

[By the way, this needs interpreting with a large grain of salt. I
haven't been following the Generics story much recently, so I could be
mis-representing things, nor do I have a particularly sound knowledge
of how GHC resolves overlapping...]
