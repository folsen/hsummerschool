You may also like to look into the 'dsp' package, that contains some 
clever algorithms for production of normally distributed random values up 
to many digits of accuracy.

http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/dsp/0.2.1/doc/html/Numeric-Random-Distribution-Normal.html

The 'dsp' package is also Haskell 98 but could certainly be split into 
smaller packages.
