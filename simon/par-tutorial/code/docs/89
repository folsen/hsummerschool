Bindings to the full hdf5 were supposed to be in the example set for
bindings-DSL. It doesn't use pkg-config, though, and hdf5 developers
didn't like the idea of adding support. I wanted reference bindings-*
libraries to be free of linking problems some users might not be able
to solve or understand, so I gave up.
