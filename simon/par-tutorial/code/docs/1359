You may have heard the rumours, and I can confirm that it's true:
HakkuTaikai is happening!

After spending a long week at ICFP 2011 talking about Haskell, why not
relax by actually hacking some Haskell?

Full details on the wiki page:

    http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/HakkuTaikai

When: Sunday, 25th September 2011
Where: Room 1208 of the NII building; the same location as ICFP.

Registration is free! See the wiki page above for details.

Feel free to email or IRC or twit me with any questions.

Many thanks to http://www.nii.ac.jp/ for hosting the event!

Cheers,
/Liyang
