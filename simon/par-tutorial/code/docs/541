Subject: [Haskell-cafe] hackage not building documentation?
Message-ID: <370569.15418.qm@web65614.mail.ac4.yahoo.com>


I uploaded a package to hackage last Saturday (16th) and the docs are not displayed yet (Wed, 20th), but it doesn't appear to be because of a build failure:

  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/swish

Is this a known issue?

Thanks,
Doug
