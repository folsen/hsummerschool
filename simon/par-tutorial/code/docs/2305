Something to finish me with, too.  I wouldn't be able to do much
in a programming world that used glyphs like that.  My vision
isn't perfect, but I think it's within a fairly normal range,
and it isn't good enough to decode a lot of hieroglyphics at
normal font size at reading speed.

The ASCII limit of 100 or so normal characters may be a barrier
to expression, but it's a boost to comprehension.
