Subject: [Haskell-cafe] How to contact OpenGL package maintainer (where
	is Sven?)

No response yet from Sven after about a month and no one seems to have heard
from him in over a year.

I'm going to take over for now under the assumption that Sven is missing.

== My plans for moving forward ==
  * Assemble an opengl taskforce, a few people have already mentioned an
interest in being on the team
  * clean up the current cabal files (I already wrote patches for that)
  * put the repos on github to make team collaboration easier
  * add the RULES that Andy Gill suggested for realToFrac
  * look at adding instances for MArray so that GLfloat et al can be stored
in IOUArrays
  * add support for opengl 4.x
  * look at adding deprecation pragmas for deprecated opengl calls
  * new hackage releases
  * anything else that comes up

Thanks,
Jason
