Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: hplaylist-0.1
Message-ID: <BANLkTinsLzXamSy4a-F3idREtRk+mhSMPQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

hplaylist is a very simple command-line utility, written in Haskell,
for automatically syncing an iTunes playlist to a
non-Apple-manufactured MP3 player (anything that mounts as a USB drive
should work in principle).

For example, if I have an iTunes playlist called "Songs about cheese",
hplaylist allows me to type:

$ hplaylist "Songs about cheese"

which automatically copies the named playlist, and all music files
included in the playlist, to my device.

Download at:

Cheers,
Tim
