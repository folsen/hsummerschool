Subject: [Haskell-cafe] how long could it wait for an account on hackageDB?
Message-ID: <87ei0c6wq4.fsf@lab1.Debian-lab>

Hello all,

I wanted to have an account on hackageDB to upload a package. I followed
http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/accounts.html, and sent an email to
ross at soi.city.ac.uk for asking an account. It's been a couple days that
I haven't heard back. Is this normal, or I have to do something else?

Thanks,
