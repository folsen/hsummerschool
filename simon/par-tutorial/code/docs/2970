Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Why is there no "splitSeperator" function in
	Data.List
Message-ID: <1297526447.2361.4.camel@robert-desktop>

Is there any reason, that one can't find a function that splits a list
at a seperator in the standard library? I imagined something like this:


    splitSeperator :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [[a]]

    splitSeperator ',' "foo,bar,baz"
      --> ["foo","bar","baz"]

Or something similar? This is needed so often, even if I can implement
it in one line, is there any reason why it's not in the libs?

Yours, Robert Clausecker
