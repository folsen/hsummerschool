Hi Will,

I attended your presentation on Zeno at AngloHaskell last year and was
really intrigued; it's great to see you've got a release up on
Hackage, and I look forward to trying it out. Are you planning on
making your source code repository publicly available on GitHub or
somewhere similar? If nothing else it would be interesting to follow
further developments between releases.

All the best,
Benedict.
