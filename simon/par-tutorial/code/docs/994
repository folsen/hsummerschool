Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Question Formlets, file upload
Message-ID: <4E414BFC.9020503@funktional.info>

  Dear all,

I am using the library Text.XHtml.Strict.Formlets to build a validating 
form. I use the function "file" to get a file upload widget. The 
encoding is set to multipart. I want to check, if the user entered 
something or left the widget empty. However, when entering nothing, 
instead of an empty string, I always get a string like "/tmp/12101" 
which corresponds to an empty file.

It would be nice, if I could check for the empty string to see, weather 
the user entered something or not into the upload widget.

I appreciate any hints to achive this and wish you a good day,
Heinrich
