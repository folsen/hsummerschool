but instead maybe "!".

The OS QNX is a hard real-time OS that uses a message passing IPC. I have
worked QNX and have written a device driver for QNX.
This job posting maybe very unfair argument against C++/OOPs as maybe the
thought is that C++ adds to much "non-determinism" to a hard real-time
problem. In the real-time extension to the POSIX API is a function "mlock"
which locks a process into memory(no swapping) which seriously helps to cut
down on non-determinism. Here Haskell would be worse with its garbage
collector with its attending non-determinism. No "OS function calls" seems
way over the top.


Sorry for my meandering thinking ....

Vasili
