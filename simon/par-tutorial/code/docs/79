If you have edges in both directions, yes.
But that's not the point for t1.
In t1, you only have (Edge start end), and a car located at start.
Then you (try to) move the car along that edge and check whether it is 
afterwards located at end.
other (Edge start end) start =gives=> end, for both, one-way and two-way 
roads, so the move yields (Car end), its location is end and t1 == True.
