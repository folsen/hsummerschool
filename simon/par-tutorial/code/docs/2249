What's wrong with that?

Incorrect. There ARE computational steps, of course, we just agree not to mention them when we talk about denotational semantics. Not mentioning something is not the same as stating that it doesn't exist.

> B. ? represents "no information", not "non-termination". There is no "non-termination" to represent.

There is, as there are computational steps. And the statement (2) above is not about denotational semantics only, so it's OK to talk about non-termination. Don't you know that you are allowed to use both semantics at the same time?

There is nothing more obscure in science then the notion of "because". fix id = (_|_) for the reason that suits your purposes.

Oh, right, there is nothing more important then using the words properly.

See above.
