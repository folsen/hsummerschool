Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Adjoint Folds and Unfolds Or: Scything through the
	Thicket of Morphisms
Message-ID: <BANLkTineFjYXf_rWGO+N-Lt1xm0E-hhcbw@mail.gmail.com>

Just tripped over this:

Adjoint Folds and Unfolds
Or: Scything through the Thicket of Morphisms

Folds and unfolds are at the heart of the algebra of programming. They
allow the cognoscenti to derive and manipulate programs rigorously...
