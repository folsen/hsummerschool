Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Module name space question
Message-ID: <CAPTT2bYJLDkx__JRKehjiTfO-rcAQkQjnfwnR6z3gSAuHE-Y+w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I recently asked about what interfaces to implement for a new data type.
Following the rule that the last 10% of work take the second 90% of time,
some other questions have come up.

If anyone wants to look at the code in question:
http://www.chr-breitkopf.de/comp/IntervalMap

Some time ago, I was looking for a data structure to search in sets of
possibly
overlapping intervals, and found only Data.SegmentTree, which did not fit
my needs
(nice term for "I did not understand the type signatures").

So I started to roll my own IntervalMap implementation. But yesterday I used
Hayoo instead of Hoogle for the first time, and found
Data.IntervalMap.FingerTree.
This has an Interface that I _do_ understand, and, while slightly different
from my
aims (depite the name, it seems more like a multi-map and does not offer
lookup
of specific keys), it raises some tasks/questions:

Tasks: Benchmark against my implementation, and maybe scrap own if it
performs worse.

And questions:

1. Why doesn't Hoogle find this?

2. Module name space pollution

I would have been so bold to name my module Data.IntervalMap. Now, since
even
Ross Patterson uses a submodule name instead, what is the accepted practice?
If I decide to release my class after all, what should be the name?
Data.IntervalMap.RedBlackTree ? Or even
Data.IntervalMap.MyDomaindNameOrSomething.
An I even have a module Data.IntervalMap.Interval, so if Ross had decided
to put
his Interval type into a separate module, even FingerTree vs RedBlackTree
would not
have prevented a name clash.

3. Are there more wothwile operations on this data structure?

Data.IntervalMap.FingerTree has 'dominators', which I missed.
A function to extract the interval with the largest endpoint might be
useful, too.
Any more ideas?

TIA,

Chris
