Pretty much what the comment says.  Graphics.X11 was never really a complete
set of bindings, just what people needed at the time.  The "Extras" stuff in
there was driven by xmonad development, for example (and named so because
originally it was a separate library before it got folded in, so the module
names were difficult to change while maintaining compatibility).  Dealing
with structs in the FFI is painful enough that I can easily imagine someone
saying "we don't need those, let someone else figure it out" --- which you
have done.  Patch away.
