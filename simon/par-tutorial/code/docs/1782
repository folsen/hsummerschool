Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Cabal issue
Message-ID: <CAMtV1SGHTbEvS2RY65bzVVwtudvrjt0S51suc_DvPizQgdUBcg@mail.gmail.com>

I understand that this may have been addressed before on this list in some
form, so I'll be brief:

Had problem with deprecated package, was told my only option was to wipe my
Haskell install and start over. Is this true and if so, doesn't this mean
that Cabal (or the package management system that it is a part of) is
broken?
