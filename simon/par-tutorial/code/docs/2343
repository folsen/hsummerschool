We hope to become experts while doing Haskell.

Sense of internal taste is very important in engineering. And this is true
whatever language you choose.

Add whole Hackage to the list an suddenly Haskell looks on par with most of
other things out there.

And that may be of course downside. If you happen do to what most other people
are doing out there, then using premade components is good option.

There was a reason 37signals decided to go with unknown little language and
create Rails from scratch. There was a reason Paul G. started viaweb in Lisp.
There was a reason that Apple things are programmed in Objective C instead of
plain C or plain Smalltalk. There was a reason that made Larry create perl
instead of sticking to awk+sed.

Of course you are to decide how much of these reasons apply to your situation.

Good luck anyway!
