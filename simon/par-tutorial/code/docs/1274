Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Is it written down somewhere what sort of things
 belong in Data.*?

I do not know of a specific definition, but I think the heuristic for
inclusion in Data is that which is neither control nor chaos.

By 'control' I mean functions that are often "baked into" other languages,
such as exception handling, bracketing, but which can be implemented as
library functions in Haskell.

By 'chaos', I mean anything specialized to a particular field (e.g.,
biology, physics), even if it be part of computer science, e.g., software
management, computer graphics.

What's left are data types and structures that are ubiquitous (e.g., lists,
sets, maps), essential for basic communication (e.g., characters, text,
encryption, serialization, persistence) or language (but not compiler)
specific (e.g., reflection, dynamic typing, generics).
