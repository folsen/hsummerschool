Can you give a specific example? Surely *something* happened :)

running cabal-dev with --verbose=3 will show you all the cabal and
ghc-pkg commands, which is probably the best way to see what's going
on.

Cabal-dev uses a custom cabal.config file that's (by default) located
in the sandbox directory.  That file specifies a package-db to use
(amongst a few other things), and cabal-install is invoked with that
config.
