+1.

At the risk of overengineering, perhaps the easiest way to deal with 
format bikeshedding is just to define an enumeration of formats just 
like the enumeration of licenses. That way machine-readable formats are 
annotated by which machine should read them, but crotchety developers 
don't have to change their changelogging preferences. After that's in 
place, then we can worry about the social pressure to get the community 
to agree on a smaller set of formats (just like has happened with licenses).
