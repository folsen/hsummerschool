Hi all,

I released the "intel-aes" package which has support for AESNI (and as a
fallback uses the same C code as AES, both with Thomas's
Crypto.Classes.BlockCipher interface).

But it has a long way to go to be portable.  I'm afraid of exactly these
sorts of compiler problems.  For arguments sake, what do you think of
prebuilding .so files for all of the common platforms?  (Especially in the
AESNI case which involves a separate makefile, assembly files, and yasm.)

I've used this strategy in intel-aes-0.1.2.  A stripped linux .so for this
purpose is 26K which doesn't seem so bad.  Of course these
compile/portability problems still need to be solved at least once to build
the libraries ;-).

Anyway this is not really my area so I'm not trying to bump anyones package
out of the way, I just wanted to get something out there with AESNI support
(before I heard Vincent was interested).

Cheers,
  -Ryan
