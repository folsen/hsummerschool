Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Haskell wiki admins -- who are they?
Message-ID: <AANLkTi=9jaLJc5Y2ZKk=SnGKC50P+kakUuNThCxNLxZd@mail.gmail.com>

  I am having some trouble getting in to my account on
  the Haskell wiki. I requested a password ~24 hours
  ago reset but have not received the email yet. Who
  should I contact about this?
