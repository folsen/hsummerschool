Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Chuan-Kai Lin's Unimo framework
Message-ID: <20111212151738.75605df1@grieve.streak>

Does anybody has an hands on experience of using Chuan-Kai Lin's Unimo framework?

It looks interesting but it seems it amounts to add an extra layer of interpretation (the monads encoding as a data type) and the paper lacks examples of actual uses of the framework.
