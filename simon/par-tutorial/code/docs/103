This is also my preferred choice.

I think I was confused between character encodings in general and
Unicode encodings.

That would validate Colin's point about there not being that many encodings.

I think I misinterpreted the word 'leading'. I thought Colin meant
"most used". The set of characters with which Haskell programmes start
is indeed small. But like you I prefer no guessing and just default to
UTF-8.
