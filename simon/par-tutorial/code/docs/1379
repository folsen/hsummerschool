Subject: [Haskell-cafe] hledger subcommand detection, RFC
Message-ID: <C25C6A8C-5F36-41FC-9AEB-E8055D00B77D@joyful.com>

When I split up the hledger package, I always intended to make the hledger program act as a single front end for hledger-* executables. I finally got around to trying that, just pushed to darcs [1]. So hledger now searches your PATH at startup and offer any hledger-* executables as subcommands. To make this fully modular, so that options can be reused and third-party add-ons don't need to be baked in to hledger in any way, there has also been a rather extensive options overhaul, using cmdargs. Below is an example [2] of the new help output with all hledger-* packages plus a local hledger-report.hs script installed.

I'm not sure if this is fully safe, cross-platform, robust, quick enough to be unnoticeable, etc. I have about 20 dirs and 4k files in my PATH. I haven't noticed a slowdown on macbook or vps, but have not measured. More testing of this on diverse platforms and machines, or code review, would be very welcome.
