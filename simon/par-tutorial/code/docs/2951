Subject: [Haskell-cafe] unicode filenames advice
Message-ID: <20110211194431.GA8708@gnu.kitenet.net>

I've been trying to deal with how my haskell program handles unicode
filenames. Been dealing with problems like those described here:

http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/3307

Or, simply demonstrated by feeding unicode to getLine >>= readFile

My approach currently is to carefully identify any point where
a FilePath is output, and run it through a filePathToString (which
varies by OS), as suggested in the above bug report.

Is there a less tedious and error-prone way? What is the best approach
to use now, assuming that these issues will be dealt with in some way
in Haskell, eventually?
