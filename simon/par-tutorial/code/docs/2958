Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Introducing monad-embed
Message-ID: <277CAD9E-489C-408B-A556-DE5C90950DB0@gmail.com>

Hi,

monad-embed is an experimental programming language that parameterizes everything on a monad by default. Examples, source code, etc. are at <http://timmaxwell.org/pages/monad-embed/>.

I posted about it on the Haskell subreddit a few months ago (see <http://bit.ly/cUZvrB>) but I was advised to re-post it in haskell-cafe as well.
