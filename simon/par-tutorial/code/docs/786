Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: New version Feldspar
Message-ID: <4DB7E2DC.80303@chalmers.se>

On behalf of the Feldspar team, I'm happy to announce version 0.4.0.2 of 
feldspar-language and feldspar-compiler:

   http://hackage.haskell.org/package/feldspar-language
   http://hackage.haskell.org/package/feldspar-compiler

Feldspar is an embedded domain-specific language for generating code for 
embedded applications, in particular for digital signal processing. For 
more information, see our web pages:

A brief list of changes since the last version:

   * Support for GHC 7.
   * Including a fresh tutorial for new users.
   * Improved C code generation (efficiency and readability).
     - Efficient vector append.
     - More unified representation of arrays in the C code.
     - Etc.
   * A new sequential construct for unfolding vectors using an 
accumulating parameter.
   * Support for structs.
   * New optimization: common sub-expression elimination.
   * Lots of restructuring under the hood.
   * Bugfixes.

/ Emil
