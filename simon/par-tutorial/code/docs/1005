Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Snap Riak Extension v0.1
Message-ID: <CAJezgr0=4Vj=cDaz5n84XUSvMiyMVAsJR=FhhO6fGsdWsQdhzw@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I released this library a while ago but didn't tell anyone, thought I would
let people know.

Would be cool to get feedback, suggestions etc.

PS: There are no recent commits since I'm going to be overhauling the
architecture once Snap 6 comes out with 'Snaplets'.
