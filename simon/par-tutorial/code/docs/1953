That's kinda where I am right now; I'm being told simultaneously that (a)
it makes sense to have Applicative and Alternative for Maybe, and (b) it
doesn't make sense to have many and some for Maybe, and (c) if you have
Applicative and Alternative then many and some automatically follow.
These statements are not mutually logically consistent, and leave me
wondering if Applicative and/or Alternative have been fully thought out.
