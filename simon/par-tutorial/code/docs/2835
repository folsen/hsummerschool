Unsurprisingly, as there's a huge space overhead, and (depending on
usage, but probably even worse) linear access time.

If the only thing you use [Word8] for is converting between arrays (for
image processing) and bytestrings (for IO), it is an O(n) cost added to
an already O(n) operation, so it's probably liveable.  

The intermediate list might be optimized away, and in any case, your
program might still be limited by disk bandwidth, so if you're lucky,
it boils down to a matter of using 20% or 40% CPU when doing file IO.
