Yes, that sounds reasonable.  Credit cards donations also cause an
overhead of 4.5% (and the 5% are deducted from the rest), so the total
overhead for a credit card donation would be: (1 - 0.955 * 0.95) =
9.3%  That's fairly high, but I don't see a way around that.

Yes, I certainly understand that.  The other reason are tax-deductible
donations, which I assume isn't really possible with Galois handling
all the financials.
