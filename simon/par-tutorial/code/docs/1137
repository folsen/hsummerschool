Sorry, I assumed you would have dbus running already.  If you add a
line like:

  eval `dbus-launch --auto-syntax`

early in your ~/.xsession (if logging in via some graphical login
manager) or ~/.xinitrc (if starting X via startx).  That should work
for any normal -sh-style or -csh-style shell.

That command starts DBus and sets the DBUS_SESSION* environment
variables, and both xmonad and taffybar need to have the same settings
for that variable, so make sure you execute that command before
starting either of them.

I'll add some notes in the documentation about this.
