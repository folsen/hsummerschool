Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: hxournal-0.5.0.0 - A pen notetaking
Message-ID: <CAKRanNDoGRaGqT-f6Ry2XmR_S1_2reYEY9POQSDZP-d-=L8XTQ@mail.gmail.com>

I got the program installed after creating the libstdc++.so symlink.
No ink shows up from my drawing though. I am on a Thinkpad X201 Tablet and
xournal works.

I am glad you are experimenting with window splits. I think the worst part
of xournal is it constrains you to a notebook-width piece of paper.
