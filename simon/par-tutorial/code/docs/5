It just unregisters libraries not delete them actually. But I guess it
is enough for you.

The "cabal-delete" command does delete libraries and I'm planning to
integrate "cab" and "cabal-delete". But the author of "cabal-delete"
is now suffering from the Tsunami in Japan. I'm just waiting for
his recovery.

I want to integrate "cab" and "cabal-dev" also. But I cannot
understand how to use "cabal-dev" at this momemnt...
