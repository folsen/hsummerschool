That does require depending on semigroups though, and I think that's
what Brandon was saying.

Of course, the obvious solution to this would be to promote semigroups,
e.g., by adding it to the Haskell Platform or including it in base...
but the current semigroups package is a bit heavyweight for that; it
exports four new modules for what is really a very simple concept!
