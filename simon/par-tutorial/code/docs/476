Subject: [Haskell-cafe] HXT and xhtml page encoded in cp1251
Message-ID: <4DACA7D5.1040206@gmail.com>

Greetings,

I'm writing a small webcrawler. Usually I used tagsoup for such tasks 
but this time I decided to give hxt a try.

Unfortunately, I ran into the troubles with character encodings. The 
site I'm targeting uses cp1251, which is the one of the most popular 
among sites in Russian. Pages contain the following meta tag
<meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=windows-1251" />

The readDocument arrow fails with the following message:

fatal error: encoding scheme not supported: "WINDOWS-1251"

Can someone suggest a workaround for my use case?

Best regards,
Dmitry
