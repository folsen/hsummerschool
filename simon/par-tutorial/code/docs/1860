Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: hxournal-0.5.0.0 - A pen notetaking
	program written in haskell
Message-ID: <CAPNnnrV329dsY_cB=K7q1-REUE5os7+u+psqN=rWeq9Crz6JEQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi, everyone,

I am very pleased to announce a pen notetaking program: hxournal,
which is written entirely in haskell using gtk2hs.

I uploaded the package on hackage. This program accompanies with
two library packages, xournal-parser and xournal-render for parsing
and rendering xournal format file.

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hxournal
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xournal-parser
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xournal-render

Installing hxournal should be very simple:
> cabal update
> cabal install hxournal

hxournal can be currently regarded as a clone of xournal, which is a
notetaking program developed in C. (See
http://xournal.sourceforge.net)

As xournal, hxournal can take wacom tablet X11 input in subpixel unit
so that it can result in very smooth notetaking experience.

Currently, basic pen operations and eraser operations, file open/save
operations, rectangular selection, cut/copy/paste operations have been
implemented. So the application is semi-usable. The file format is
the same as xournal but gunzipped. So to view/edit xoj files generated
from xournal, just gunzip the xoj files and read them in hxournal.
Gunzipped xoj files generated from hxournal are readable in xournal
program.

One NEW special feature of hxournal compared with xournal:
This program can make a split view (horizontal and vertical and
arbitrary combination of them) of the same document similarly to emacs
buffers and windows. Please try Horizontal/Vertical Split in View menu
of the program. This will be convenient when notetaking a long
document.

The git repository is located at https://www.github.com/wavewave/hxournal
The program web page and development web/wiki pages will be announced
soon (it will be linked from package webpage on hackage anyway) and
the detailed manual will be presented there.

Thank you for your interest.
Enjoy haskell notetaking!
