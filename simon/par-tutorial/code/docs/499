Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: cereal-0.3.1.0
Message-ID: <4DADC53C.7020407@galois.com>

Hi Everyone,

I'm proud to announce version 0.3.1.0 of the cereal
binary-(de)serialization library [1]!

This version includes some new functionality contributed by Lemmih, that
adds support for partial parses in the Get monad.  The changes don't
modify the API presented in 0.3.0.0, instead adding a new runPartialGet
function for the Get monad when partial parses are desired.
