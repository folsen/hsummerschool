Hi Peter.. thanks for the follow-up. In case it wasn't clear, I do  
realise now that attempts to over-specify depedencies to avoid  
practical cabal install issues can backfire, and a package author  
should just accept that cabal install can't be made 100% reliable  
installation method for non-experts (for now - I know many people are  
thinking about this).

And, I've fixed/relaxed the process dependency in hledger head, and  
only laziness/business has prevented that from being released to  
hackage. I'll do that asap.

Cheers - Simon
