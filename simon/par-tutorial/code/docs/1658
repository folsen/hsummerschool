That's true even for regular fork/exec.

all straightforward to determine the actual location of the executable,  
especially not in a platform-independent manner. argv[0] can't be trusted,  
scanning through $PATH isn't guaranteed to find it (and even if you find  
something of the right name, it's not guaranteed to be the correct  
executable), etc etc.

In particular, with posix_spawnp(), the $PATH that is used to find the  
executable
and the $PATH in the environment that the executable starts with can be two  
different things.
