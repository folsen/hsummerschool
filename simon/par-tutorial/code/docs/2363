Subject: [Haskell-cafe] [ANNOUNCEMENT] SBV 0.9.24 is out
Message-ID: <CACOpX0ecM-_wLNTJcmjepWsr1ScXyeo1b+HPeTcHBWZy4CtV=A@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all,

SBV 0.9.24 is out: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv

In short, SBV allows for scripting SMT solvers directly within
Haskell, with built-in support for bit-vectors and unbounded integers.
(Microsoft's Z3 SMT solver, and SRI's Yices can be used as backends.)

New in this release are SMT based optimization (both quantified and
iterative), and support for explicit domain constraints with vacuity
check.

Full release notes: http://github.com/LeventErkok/sbv/blob/master/RELEASENOTES

Happy new year!

-Levent.
