That seems to be related to a change in Monad instances, formerly, there 
was an

instance (Error e) => Monad (Either e) where ...

defined in Control.Monad.Error, now there's an

instance Monad (Either e) where ...

defined in Control.Monad.Instances. So in Data.Encoding.ByteSource, there's 
an

instance Monad (Either DecodingException) where ...

but that wouldn't work with the new instance, so it's conditionally 
included per


#ifndef MIN_VERSION_mtl(2,0,0,0)
instance Monad (Either DecodingException) where
...
#endif

Apparently that doesn't work as expected, probably should be

#if !MIN_VERSION_mtl(2,0,0)

Short of changing the code, try installing encoding-0.6.3; that built with 
ghc-6.12 on hackage, so it should work for you.

Unrelated, but that looks like trouble waiting for an opportunity to bite 
you.
