The situation is more that I have a number of independent changes that
I'd like to experiment with locally, without ever releasing them
individually -- if/when they're released, they would build without the
need to set the flag.  The net effect is very similar to maintaining
multiple branches of the primary project, but with more separation
between the stable project and the experimental code.
