Intricate indeed. If some day you have too much time, consider adding 
configuration options for that. Until then, how about putting that in the 
docs?

Not ideal (for me), but good enough I think. Although, I find kate's 
configuration option to start autocompletion after n letters *very* nice.

Pity.

So there's initial support for it, good sign.

Will do. Unfortunately I had to wipe the old OS from disk and now have to 
rebuild a couple of GHCs and a load of libraries (different gmp version), 
that'll take a while.

That's natural, collecting the data isn't free.

I'm not sure about that. According to top, leksah-server used that much 
memory long after ghc ran last. And on the second start, it didn't invoke 
ghc (at least, no ghc was reported by top). Looks a bit as though it 
doesn't write the data soon enough. Or it could have been the first sign of 
my OS crashing.

That's more reasonable. We'll see.

Yes, but as mentioned above, that'll not be immediately.
