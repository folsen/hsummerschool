Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Type checker for haskell-src-exts (was:

What exactly are the hopes for such a type checker?  I can understand
it being interesting as a research project, but as a realistic tools
there are two huge issues:

 1. It's going to take a LOT of time to reach feature parity with
GHC's type checker.

 2. Assuming that can be done, how is it going to be maintained and
kept up to date with GHC?

If it is going to be used as a development tool, both of these are a
major requirement.  I haven't looked into the issues, but I'd expect
it would be more realistic (although definitely not trivial) to
translate from GHC's internal AST into an annotated haskell-src-exts
AST.
