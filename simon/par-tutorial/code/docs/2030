I believe that you're absolutely right. I also believe that corporate
decision makers rarely, if ever, think that way. And that's the problem:
You have to deal with the perception, not the reality.

So, that's the real question that needs to be answered: How do you deal
with the _perception_ that hiring a Haskell developer instead of a
Rails, etc. developer will result in more chaos when said developer is
hit by a bus?
