Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: smallcheck-0.6;

Message-ID: <20111211220102.GA15828@sniper>

I'm pleased to announce a new release of SmallCheck.

The highlights for this release are:

* Default Generic implementation of Serial instance, contributed by Bas van Dijk
  
    This means that you don't need to write instances by hand for your types
    to generate test values for them. See [1] for the details.
    [1]: http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/smallcheck/0.6/doc/html/Test-SmallCheck-Series.html#g:5

* Revised, organised into modules and documented API

* Integration with test-framework, through test-framework-smallcheck package

    It allows to organize SmallCheck properties into a test suite (possibly
    together with HUnit or QuickCheck tests), apply timeouts, get nice
    statistics etc. 

    Thanks to Max Bolingbroke for cooperation on this front.

Please refer to the README for more information about SmallCheck:
