I'd much rather have _ on the RHS of equations be a way of specifying 
terms that the compiler should infer. This is pretty standard for 
dependently typed languages, and more closely mimics the behavior of _ 
on the LHS as a gensym-named pattern variable.

For Haskell we could perhaps use Djinn to infer the term and have 
compilation fail if there isn't a unique total function/value that can 
be inferred for the missing term.
