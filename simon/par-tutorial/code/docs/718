Well, it is a bit more intricate to invert the sides. After 
* swapping LeftP and RightP in Edit Prefs -> Initial Pane positions
* Close all panes and pane groups. (You may leave an editor window open,
so that you better see what happens in the next steps).
* Collapse all (Hit Ctrl-1 - 2 times)
* Split vertical (Hit Ctrl-2), put the focus to the left, split horizontal
(Hit Ctrl-3)
* Go to Panes Menu and reopen the Log and the Browser and an editor Window
* Configure tabs as you like
* Save the session or restart Leksah

Go to Edit Prefs -> GUI Options, and select "Complete only on Hotkey", then
hit
Ctrl-Space if you want completion.

You can't do this currently, but you can post a wish for enhancement to our
issue tracker.

Please try to run Leksah with the default config
(~/.leksah-0.10/packageSources)

Indeed leksah may use more memory on the first run (actually it is ghc,
which uses it).
But on consecutive starts it may use about/up to 150MB, but not the numbers
you give.
So please try to run Leksah with the default config, and see if the problem
remains.
