are the versions in the new platform already mostly fixed? I?d like to
add them to the tracker at
http://people.debian.org/~nomeata/platform.html but the repo
http://code.haskell.org/haskell-platform/ seems to be empty (maybe due
to the recent break-in?).

This is assuming that
http://code.haskell.org/haskell-platform/haskell-platform.cabal is still
the right place to look at the state of the to-be-released platform
cabal file.

Greetings,
Joachim
