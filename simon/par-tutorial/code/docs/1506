There might be something off about your packages database.

I just did:

$ cabal update
$ cabal install parsec
$ ghci
> import Text.Parsec.Prim

and it went fine.

Also, the module "Text.Parsec" re-exports the entirety of
"Text.Parsec.Prim", so you won't get much advantage importing the
"Prim" module on its own.
