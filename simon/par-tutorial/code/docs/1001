No, GHC calls out to C for 64-bit integer ops on all 32-bit platforms.

Actually, fromIntegral is usually a no-op, so chances are you're seeing the
effect of something else.

It's cheaper again to use quotInt# and remInt# as I did in my code.

GHC has to deconstruct the Vector in order to get at the real underlying
array, so that unsafeIndex can perform the actual index into the real
underlying array.

Without bang patterns, the code performs at least one deconstruction on
every iteration through the loop. Each deconstruction has a cost. With the
bang patterns, they're all hoisted out and performed just once.
