Thanks for your suggestion.  Yes, that's what i was thinking of doing;
but i wanted to know before that if there might be reasons for people
not being able or not wanting to use parsec 3 (in which case i might try
to rewrite the parsing code using parsec 2-compatible calls, assuming
there's a compatibility layer in parsec 3).


Cheers,
jao
