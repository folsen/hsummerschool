Agreed. I'd love to see a good code host for darcs.

Actually, for my uses, the code hosting itself isn't that important 
---since darcs can fabulously be hosted from any http server--- but 
rather, what I'd like is someplace to keep my code which also provides a 
good bugtracker. Unfortunately, neither darcsden nor patchtag offer 
bugtrackers (AFAIK) and neither github, bitbucket, nor googlecode offer 
darcs.
