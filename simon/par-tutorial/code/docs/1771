Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Does anyone maintain trac.haskell.org?
Message-ID: <CABPxb2kwxxkuvP2RcRqmDbMmVyob1dsxo2=BdOCdCpJ3etY8bQ@mail.gmail.com>

The community Trac hosting server isn't sending email, which Trac requires.

I've submitted several tickets to support at community.haskell.org but
gotten no response.

Does anyone maintain that server anymore?

Justin
