Is pkg-config available for MSys? It might help matters if it is - I
think Cabal has direct support for pkg-config.

Otherwise point Cabal to the location of the .a file with
--extra-lib-dirs. You will also have to point to the headers with
--extra-include-dirs.

If you are compiling with GHC straight rather than using a Cabal file,
I think it will need a -l (lower L) flag for the lib and -I (upper i)
for headers.
