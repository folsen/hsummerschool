Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: vector-algorithms 0.5.2
Message-ID: <CAHEA9tOAYecWbFPgTtUkSUJXuow9NLy6U7dYgHyOzQWwMepVCQ@mail.gmail.com>

Greetings,

Following some work at hac-phi, I've finally put together a new
release of vector-algorithms. It should now be available via hackage,
or you can pull from code.haskell.org if you prefer:

  hackage: http://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector-algorithms/
  latest: darcs get http://code.haskell.org/~dolio/vector-algorithms/

The highlights of the new release are as follows:

  - Some bit rot in the test suite has been fixed
  - Some strictness has been added to the merge sort to improve
unboxing on current GHCs
  - A couple out-of-bounds errors have been caught and fixed
  - An entirely new sort---American flag sort---has been added to the line-up
    * American flag sort is an in-place bucket sort, which only uses a
constant amount
      of auxiliary heap space (determined by the element type). And
unlike a typical
      radix sort, it is actually suitable for sorting arrays of
variable-length (O(1) lookup)
      strings. To this end, there is a (strict) ByteString instance
for the relevant class,
      and possibly more such instances to come.

Bug reports, patches, requests, etc. can be sent to me at this address.

Enjoy,

-- Dan
