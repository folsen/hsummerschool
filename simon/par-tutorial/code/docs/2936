There are other uses for code than compilation.  Let's say I wrote a
wrapper for a proprietary library that connects to Oracle databases.
Any program using this would likely be undistributable.  Still, having
the wrapper free would allow porting it to a free database back end or
using it for teaching, so there's always added value in added freedom.

I don't think you are contradicting me here.  My point is that authors
are not likely to be liable or bound by other's licenses - whether they
are concerned or not, is up to them.

I think usability goes way beyond redistributability, but I
guess we should just agree to disagree on this.

IMO, the important thing is that cabal avoids imposing legal
straightjackets on authors, and that it avoids making legal
interpretations.  Echoing facts from cabal files is okay, but drawing
legal conclusions based on these facts should be the responsibility
(i.e. both obligation and liability) of the individual user.
