Hi Antoine,

I am sorry, my previous statement was inaccurate. Parsec 3.1.2 compiles
fine, but the 'text' library -- on which Parsec depends -- does not. We
can probably avoid that issue by downgrading text to version 0.11.0.6
for GHC 6.10.4, which builds fine. It's not a pretty solution, but it
seems to work fine.

So, the good news is that we now have Parsec 3 available for GHC 6.10.4
in NixOS after all. :-)

Take care,
Peter
