I am not saying they are bad, but when I returned to emacs after two years of using vim, I was disappointed by their functionality and especially by the integration between third-party emacs-modes and the vi emulations. Though, I believe there is some work on new vim emulators. I am not sure on their status. They are probably no non-brainer option, yet.

What I really liked about Claus Reinke's haskell-mode for vim was the ability to insert update statements with one command.

Cheers,
