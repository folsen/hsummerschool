I have doubts that there is a relevant saving of space when putting this
code in a package of its own:

======snip========
module Data.ObjectName ( ObjectName(..) ) where
-- | An 'ObjectName' is an explicitly handled identifier for API objects, e.g. a
-- texture object name in OpenGL or a buffer object name in OpenAL.
class ObjectName a where
   -- | Generate a given number of object names, which are guaranteed to be
   -- unused. By generating the names, they become used.
   genObjectNames :: Int -> IO [a]
   -- | Make the given object names available again, declaring them as unused.
   deleteObjectNames:: [a] -> IO ()
   -- | Test if the given object name is currently in use, i.e. test if it has
   -- been generated, but not been deleted so far.
   isObjectName :: a -> IO Bool
======snip========

considering that there is a license file, a .cabal file, it will create
separate haddock data with an index.html, an alphabetical index, it will
have an entry of its own in the package file, you will have to look at
the package name when upgrading, more dependencies that cabal-install
needs to think about...

And with TeX, at least here, all the small .sty packages are then
distributed as one big thing called texlive (split into large sets such
that ?humanities?, ?science?, ?publishing?), probably because it is too
tedious to individually package and select what package I really want.

If the trend to micro-package continues on Hackage, maybe that is what
will happening: Someone will create collections of packages, similar to
the plaform, maybe one for graphics (containing opengl, gtk2hs, etc.),
one for audio. And then distributors would have packages corresponding
to those bundles.

Greetings,
Joachim
