I think that author sin't quite right there.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29
Haskell (pronounced /?h?sk?l/) is a standardized, general-purpose
purely functional programming language, with *non-strict* semantics
and strong static typing.

Haskell is great because of non-strictness.
