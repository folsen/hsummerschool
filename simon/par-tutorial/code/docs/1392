Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Ambiguous module name `System.Directory'
Message-ID: <20110826160018.GB23687@sirch>

Hi,

i am using ghc version 7.0.3 and a pretty recent version of the
haskell-platform.

Whenever i use the System.Directory module, i run into this
conflict:

Ambiguous module name `System.Directory':
         it was found in multiple packages:
             system-fileio-0.2.1 directory-1.1.0.0

How can i resolve this conflict permamently (i know about 
:set -hide-package ... )? And shouldn't there be a rule in the
haskell platform which forbids modules of the same name?

Greetings 
Chris
