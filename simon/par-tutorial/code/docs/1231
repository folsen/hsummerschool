Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Can I have a typeclass for topological spaces?

You may want to, instead, check out the methods of point-free topology
(also known as pointless topology) where you, basically, study
topological spaces in terms of their open-set lattices.

This allows you to use a more algebraic language which probably fits
better into Haskell (I think this is used, for example, when studying
topology within type theories). A search for stone-duality should give
you somewhere to start (I know there are a sequence of posts on
http://topologicalmusings.wordpress.com/ on the subject).

Somewhat less known is the theory of formal topology (see for example
n-lab http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/formal+topology). Which might also
be an approach to doing some topology in Haskell.

Hope that's of some help :)
