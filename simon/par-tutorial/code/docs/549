Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Hackage haddock not running?
Message-ID: <1303320363.2836.1.camel@godel>

I've noticed a lot of packages recently missing documentation links on
Hackage.  It looks like the job to build these hasn't been running since
perhaps about Saturday.  Are appropriate people aware of this?
