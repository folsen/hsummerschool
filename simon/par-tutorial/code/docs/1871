Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Cabal: Disjunctive Build-Depends
Message-ID: <CAL3m8eDWP+EOp49wEi1MnvRzyRd-wrv2qRo8iwBfoqhrs75VAw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello all.

I have written some code that can be compiled with either of two
libraries, with no modification. How can I tell Cabal?

I tried "||" but it failed to parse.

I could find which package is available in the build script, and then
call defaultMainNoRead with the appropriate GenericPackageDescription,
but I'm not sure how to find this system-agnostically.

Thanks for any help.

Cheers,
Matthew Farkas-Dyck
