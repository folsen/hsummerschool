You might want to depend on Conal Elliott's vector-space library
rather than implement your own vector space class. Then you don't need
the associated datatype which might allow simpler datatypes for
colours and vectors.

Also Conal's library is quite well used, so it does mean the operator
names will be familiar to other programmers.

Best wishes
