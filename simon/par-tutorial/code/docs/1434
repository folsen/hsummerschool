Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Trouble with Haddock
Message-ID: <CA+MSfs+UnoFU-Ej6np3yKkKz82gyHN5T=KD7j7rrx7Q0pgp_Gw@mail.gmail.com>

First time using haddock.
I'm unable to include code examples in the module header.
Haddock fails with this error:
haddock module header parse failed: Cannot parse header
documentation paragraphs

It's about 12 lines of code, which doesn't seem like much compared to other
packages.

e.g.
-- | describing module
--
-- > code
-- > ...
-- > code
module Foo
   ( ....


I tried @...@ code blocks, but that didn't work either.
If I shorten the code to 3 lines or so, it will work.
