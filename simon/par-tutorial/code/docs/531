monad-control builds fine on my system with both GHC 7.0.3 and 6.12.3.

$ uname -a
Linux notebookbas 2.6.38-8-generic #42-Ubuntu SMP Mon Apr 11 03:31:24
UTC 2011 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

I do get some "Unrecognised pragma" warnings when building on 6.12.3
because I use the new INLINABLE pragma for a bunch of functions. Maybe
I can add some CPP magic to only enable that when building on GHC-7.

Regards,

Bas
