Quotes of the Week

   * kmc: when computer scientists rebuild the world after the
     apocalypse, we will have hanging gardens with trees that grow
     downward

   * kmc: a wise man once said that the entire world can be described as
     convex combinations of drugs, math, and cardboard

   * roconnor: as a rule of thumb, avoid any packages shipped with the
     Haskell Plaform.

   * kmc: Try the new GHC IO Scheduler! It's got what plants crave!

   * kmc: I refuse to believe that any loving god would invent the
     monomorphism restriction

   * AlanPerlis: It is easier to write an incorrect program than
     understand a correct one.

   * [kmc] do you have a theory where the stack overflow is
        coming from?
     [copumpkin] joel spolsky

   * @faq is it possible to find things Haskell can't do?
     [lambdabot] The answer is: Yes! Haskell can do that.

   * kmc: Haskell isn't really designed by mathematicians. it's designed
     by people who programmers would consider to be mathematicians and
     mathematicians would consider to be programmers
