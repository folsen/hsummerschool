Looking at iconv.cabal from the iconv package, I found this:

  if os(darwin) || os(freebsd)
    -- on many systems the iconv api is part of the standard C library
    -- but on some others we have to link to an external libiconv:
    extra-libraries: iconv

So the problem is that the extra library iconv is not been considered
for the windows os.

Changing the line above to consider the windows os solves the problem:

  if os(darwin) || os(freebsd) || os(windows)
    -- on many systems the iconv api is part of the standard C library
    -- but on some others we have to link to an external libiconv:
    extra-libraries: iconv


Therefore the mantainer of the iconv package should fix this issue.
