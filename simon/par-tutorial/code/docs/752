To some extent, you can see such a relation in gitk. For mercurial, hg glog 
also shows a bit. I suppose there's also something to visualise branches in 
bazaar, but I've never used that, so I don't know.

So, with gitk/glog, you can see that foo branched off bar after commit 
0de8793fa1bc..., then checkout/update to that commit [or bar's head], 
checkout/update to foo's head/tip and compare.

Or there could be some feature I've never heard of yet.
