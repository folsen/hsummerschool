Being in the same typeclass means that you can define

 ?instance Alternative Maybe where
    ...
    some Nothing = Nothing
    some (Just _) = error "Alternative.some: used with Just (loops forever)"
    many Nothing = Nothing
    many (Just _) = error "Alternative.many: used with Just (loops forever)"

Cheers,
