I agree.  If at some point we feel that having a Haskell Foundation
would be desirable (despite the additional overheads) there shouldn't
be anything stopping us from doing so.  Are there any drawbacks in
joining such an organisation?  How do they finance their overheads?
Would a donation to haskell.org include a fee to SPI?  I couldn't find
any information on their website.
