                        Final Call For Papers
                        =====================

  _EXTENDED SUBMISSION DEADLINE : December 16, 2011_

  *Eleventh International Symposium on Functional and Logic
Programming (FLOPS 2012)*
  May 23-25, 2012
  Kobe, Japan
  [http://www.org.kobe-u.ac.jp/flops2012/]

  FLOPS is a forum for research on all issues concerning declarative
  programming, including functional programming and logic programming,
  and aims to promote cross-fertilization and integration between the
  two paradigms. Previous FLOPS meetings were held in Fuji Susono
  (1995), Shonan Village (1996), Kyoto (1998), Tsukuba (1999), Tokyo
  (2001), Aizu (2002), Nara (2004), Fuji Susono (2006), Ise (2008),
  and Sendai (2010).

Topics
======
  FLOPS solicits original papers in all areas of functional and logic
  programming, including (but not limited to):
  - Declarative Pearls: new and excellent declarative programs with
    illustrative applications.
  - Language issues: language design and constructs, programming methodology,
    integration of paradigms, interfacing with other languages, type systems,
    constraints, concurrency and distributed computing.
  - Foundations: logic and semantics, rewrite systems and narrowing, type
    theory, proof systems.
  - Implementation issues: compilation techniques, memory management, program
    analysis and transformation, partial evaluation, parallelism.
  - Applications: case studies, real-world applications, graphical user
    interfaces, Internet applications, XML, databases, formal methods and model
    checking.

  The proceedings will be published as an LNCS volume. The proceedings
  of the previous meeting (FLOPS 2010) were published as LNCS 6009.

Submission
==========
  Submissions must be unpublished and not submitted for publication
  elsewhere. Work that already appeared in unpublished or informally
  published workshops proceedings may be submitted. Submissions should
  fall into one of the following categories:
  - Regular research papers: they should describe new results and will be
    judged on originality, correctness, and significance.
  - System descriptions: they should contain a link to a working system and
    will be judged on originality, usefulness, and design.
  Submissions must be written in English and can be up to 15 pages
  long, though pearls are typically considerably shorter. Authors are
  required to use LaTeX2e and the Springer llncs class file, available at
  [http://www.springer.de/comp/lncs/authors.html].

  Regular research papers should be supported by proofs and/or
  experimental results. In case of lack of space, this supporting
  information should be made accessible otherwise (e.g., a link to a
  web page, or an appendix). Papers should be submitted electronically
  at [https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=flops2012].
