Hi Jose,

 > Peter, would using parsec 3.x be an acceptable solution to you?

well, we can link xmobar with parsec 3.x on NixOS. The situation
is tricky, though, because the latest version of parsec that we
have, 3.1.2, doesn't compile with GHC 6.10.4 anymore, so we'd
have to use some older version to work around that problem. That
kind of setup somewhat complicated to maintain, which is why I
would prefer to compile xmobar with parsec 2 2 if at all
possible.

Generally speaking, though, GHC 6.10.4 support is not a high
priority. I just thought it might be worth pointing out that
backwards compatibility has been lost in the 0.14 release,
because earlier versions worked just fine.

Take care,
Peter
