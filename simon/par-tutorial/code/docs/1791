Since you ask how other packages solve this problem, and since most
packages use template haskell, I have to ask: why can't you use
template haskell for this?

Another option (also not code generation, but very useful in reducing
boilerplate) is generic programming, for example using the 'regular'
package, or the new generics in GHC 7.2.
