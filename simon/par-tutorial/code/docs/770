git show-branch [branches]

It was one of nicest things in git for me when I stared to use it.

xmms2-devel $ git show-branch
! [error-on-implicit] OTHER: wscript: make implicit function declarations an error in C code
 * [master] FEATURE(2184): Update pre-generated cython files.
  ! [missing-protos] OTHER: one more me in AUTHORS

+   [error-on-implicit] OTHER: wscript: make implicit function declarations an error in C code
  + [missing-protos] OTHER: one more me in AUTHORS
  + [missing-protos^] OTHER: explicitely declare g_sprintf()
  + [missing-protos~2] OTHER: explicitely declare semtimedop()
+*+ [master] FEATURE(2184): Update pre-generated cython files.

The simpler things are:
git [log|diff] from..to
git [log|diff] from...to

Set of [commits|changes] to be added to another branch.
