Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ICFP Hotel Roommate
Message-ID: <CAKsxMn9-McP0bwbxTW-w+uEMSfZpSbvp8-ViB7my-SOK_BR8HQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'll be heading to ICFP in September, and I'm hoping to find someone to
share a room with to save on hotel costs.  Are there any other students
looking for a roommate?

Cheers,
Dan
