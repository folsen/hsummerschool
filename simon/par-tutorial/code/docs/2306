Subject: [Haskell-cafe] How to get Cabal to spit out a .a library
	suitable	for linking into C/Objective-C

Sorry about the belated response, but this shouldn't be a problem since
it isn't going to be very helpful anyway!

I've managed to follow the process described on this page:
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Using_Haskell_in_an_Xcode_Cocoa_project
to link Haskell code to a non-Haskell main program, via Xcode.

You've probably already seen this, it's mostly about a few iterations
of trial and error linking, to get the list of GHC library dependencies,
which is what you need whether you're using Xcode or not.  If you really
need a single library with your code and all those dependencies, that
may be technically feasible, though awfully tedious.

The only clear problem I encountered while experimenting with it is that
GHC run time options need ghc -rtsopts, so they're unavailable if your
program isn't built by ghc.  I believe I worked around that with a special
rtsmain.o, could probably recover the details if that's of interest.
