Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Python is lazier than Haskell
Message-ID: <alpine.DEB.2.00.1104271123020.5485@anubis>


I like to apply for the quote of the week. :-)

   "If Haskell is great because of its laziness,
    then Python must be even greater,
    since it is lazy at the type level."

Dynamically typed languages only check types if they have to, that is if 
expressions are actually computed. Does this prove that laziness at type 
level as in Python is a great thing or does this prove that laziness at 
the value level as in Haskell is a bad thing or does this prove nothing?

Hope for controversial discussion ...
