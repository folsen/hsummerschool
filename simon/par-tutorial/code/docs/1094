Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Haskell Actors, Linda, publish / subscribe models?
Message-ID: <CAMXF=YBjfyjA8NqSH9HyngS_UZDr_4cYJiv_8Lh1zNfepJYs9w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
I am trying to figure out what Haskell libraries can be used to build
publish / subscribe communication between threads running both in the same
and different address spaces on the net.
For my needs any of these models will work:
- Actors [ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model ]
- Linda tuple space [
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_%28coordination_language%29 ]
- Publish / subscribe [
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Message_Service#Publish.2Fsubscribe_model]

I need to build a framework to coordinate task producers / consumers
distributed in the same and different address spaces. I need to scale a data
processing application somewhat Hadoop-like way yet in more flexible manner,
without Hadoop-specific distributed FS constraints.

Looking through Applications and libraries/Concurrency and parallelism:
http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Applications_and_libraries/Concurrency_and_parallelism

I found Haskell actor package [
http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/actor ] that
fails to build with ghc 7.0.

Please advise on latest working libraries.

Thanks!

All the best,
