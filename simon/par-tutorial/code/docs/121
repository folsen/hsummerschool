That looks as though you have two random-1.0.0.2 packages (and two time 
packages), probably one in the global package-db and one in the user-db.
haskell98 depends on the one in the global db and probably HaXml depends on 
the one in the user-db.

For some package you installed (or did you perchance run cabal upgrade?), 
cabal seems to have reinstalled random and time (possibly more), that's not 
good.

Ask ghc-pkg about broken packages,
$ ghc-pkg check

You might need to remove packages from the user-db

You have mtl-2.*, but encoding would need mtl-1.* it seems, but it hasn't 
put an upper bound on that dependency. Notify author/maintainer.

To circumvent the build failure, have an mtl-1.*, but no mtl-2.* available, 
then it should build (or you could edit the source to replace all 
occurrences of the data constructor State with the function state to make 
it build with mtl-2.*).
