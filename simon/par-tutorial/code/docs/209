Work is ongoing for a version of hackage that you can just
install on your own server. Perhaps the people working on that
can comment about the status.

If all you want is a barebones server that you can upload
packages to for use via cabal-install, you can get:

http://hackage.haskell.org/package/yackage

Hope this helps,
