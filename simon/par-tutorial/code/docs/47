Unless its changed significantly since I looked at it last (which it may 
well have), it's not possible. The problem is that what we'd really need 
is lowerIO :: m a -> IO a for the m in question; liftIO goes the wrong 
way. Of course, getting a lowerIO with the right semantics will be 
tricky for most monads.
