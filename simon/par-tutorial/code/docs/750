More specifically than that.  This is the workflow I follow with darcs
repos.  Say, that I want to get the Foo repo:
mkdir ~/repos/Foo
cd ~/repos/Foo
darcs get http://example.com/Foo HEAD
darcs get HEAD feature-branch

Then I can send the patches from feature-branch to the official Foo repo at
any time.  I can also merge them back into HEAD doing a darcs pull from
feature-branch to HEAD.

I think this is quite comparable to the git workflow.

You can use gitk to see how the histories have interacted.
