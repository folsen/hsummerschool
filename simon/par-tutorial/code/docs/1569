Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Using Data,TypeLevel.Num
Message-ID: <B26461F6-5C11-4EFC-935C-7755BB0D3533@cs.otago.ac.nz>

I'd like to write a small module using Data.TypeLevel.Num.
It has type level constants, variables, addition, and maximum, which is pretty much
all I need.  But I've never used it before, and there's one thing I want to do that
I don't understand how to do.

	val :: Nat t => t -> Int
	val _ = t as an Int

e.g., if x :: D8 then val x = 8.

The "value-level reflection functions" in Data.TypeLevel.Num.Ops all seem to be
'undefined'.
