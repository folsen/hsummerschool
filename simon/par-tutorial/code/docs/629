Subject: [Haskell-cafe] naming convention for maybes?

I do it in a similar way, not just for maybes:

paramMay <- getHTTPPostParam "Param"
paramStr <- maybe (throwError "No Param parameter") return paramMay
let paramE = parseParam paramStr
param <- case paramE of
Left e -> throwError $ "Error while parsing Param: " ++ show e
Right p -> return p

It'd be great, if there was a "centralised" naming convention guide.
