Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Is Hugs dead?

By the way, I'd like to use hugs extensively as sysadmin's universal 
scripting language. I think, it could be a great killer feature. But as 
far as I know, it doesn't have any facilities to run external programs 
and process their stdout, stderr end exit code.

Hugs is much more suitable for the task then ghc because of its 
compactness and portability. And some people think that haskell code is 
easier to maintain than shell scripts, perl or even python.
