Yes, the haskell-emacs is nice. It provides two separate implementations of indentation engines: haskell-indent and haskell-indentation. And you can use emacs default indentation. I use haskell-indent because it considers the right indentation candidates for my coding style [1].

Regarding, your question whether this is worth switching from vim to emacs. I've been using both editors for some years and I very much doubt, that "you wouldn't spend much time learning emacs". If you are comfortable with vim, stick with it, unless you are interested in Emacs or one of its really great modes: org and auctex/reftex.

Regarding, the vi emulations, I'd say they are nice should you ever be forced to use emacs for some time. But I don't recommend them, I've tried them all. They are not the real thing. Most of them are vi not vim emulators. And they always feel like second class citizens in emacs land. YMMW.

[1]: But I am not able to configure it to place "where" where I like it, indented by half the normal indentation width.

Cheers,
 Jean
