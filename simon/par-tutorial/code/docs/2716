I don't know enough about the native code generator to make a claim like 
that, but we're not comparing the native code generator against a C 
compiler; we're comparing it against a C code generator whose output is 
fed through a C compiler. These are very different things, and I think 
it gives the native code generator an edge. My own observations from 
immediately before the C backend was deprecated was that the native code 
generator averaged slightly better performing code.
