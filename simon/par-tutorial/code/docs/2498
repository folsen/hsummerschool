Honestly, I'm not trying to get you to speak less, but rather to share your
perspective more clearly. I've have more than my fill of circular arguments
and ill-defined claims.

I'm reminded of a quote from David R. MacIver in ?A problem of
language<http://www.drmaciver.com/2009/05/a-problem-of-language/>",
