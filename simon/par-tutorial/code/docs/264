In the case of functions where the domain and range are finite, function
equality is decidable but not usually feasible.  If your function is a
combinatorial circuit, you can apply technology like SAT solvers to
hopefully decide equality in faster than exponential time (this is what
Cryptol does; you may find it interesting.)
