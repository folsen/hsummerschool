Yes, it's quite possible.

One difference to note is that we use ssh key based logins, not
passwords. We suspect this saved us from the worst case scenarios.

Nevertheless, while we don't have to reset passwords, we are concerned
about the potential that the attacker replaced or added to users
~/.ssh/authorized_keys lists, which is why we have not yet re-enabled
user accounts.

We will try and provide as full a picture as we can when we're satisfied
we've got as much info and confidence as we're likely to get.
