Subject: [Haskell-cafe] How to get a file path to the program invoked?
Message-ID: <CAMXF=YBsT3fvqcuYG_JUZ_5eS1RVBGXsC2r5oLqH2BvGuhjdMQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,
When my program starts it needs to know a complete path to the directory
from which it was invoked.
In terms of standard shell (sh) I need the Haskell function that will do
equivalent to:

#!/bin/sh
path=$(dirname $0)

How to get this path in Haskell?

getProgName :: IO String
defined System.Environment only returns a file name of the program without
its full path.

Thanks!
