Subject: [Haskell-cafe] [ANNOUNCEMENT] xmobar 0.14
Message-ID: <87k464b870.fsf@gnu.org>


I'm happy to announce the release of xmobar 0.14.

Xmobar is a text-based, minimalistic status bar for linuxy systems,
written in Haskell.  See http://projects.haskell.org/xmobar for
details.

Many, many thanks to the many, many contributors, and apologies for
taking so long to put their code and fixes under a new release.

In this episode:

_New features_

  - New brightness monitor, courtesy of Martin Perner.
  - New DateZone plugin, for configurable timezone and localized
    datetimes, also by Martin.
  - New keyboard layout monitor (Kbd).  Yes, by Martin.
  - Rewrite of the event handling ([issue 53], [issue 57]), you
    guessed it.
  - Cpu monitor now also reports `iowait` field ([issue 55]).
  - Battery monitor: the full charge file is now settable in the
    monitor arguments (olpc systems use `charge_full_design`; see
    [issue 62]).

_Bug fixes_

  - [issue 45]: Fix for crashes with AC status changes in battery monitor.
  - [issue 48]: The <quality> field of Wireless behaves like a percentage.
  - [issue 50]/[issue 61]: `MPD` monitor now works with libmpd 0.6.
  - [issue 60]: Fixes for crashes on power resume for battery monitor.
  - Template sections without fields are now correctly displayed.
  - Catch errors when reading battery status (Ben Boeckel).
  - Compilation issues with ghc 7.x (Sergei Trofimovich).
  - Fixes for CoreTemp monitor in new kernels (Norbert Zeh).
  - Fix for pulseaudio problems in volume monitor (Martin Perner).
  - Fix for parsing errors when a `Run` entry ended in an array
    (Martin).
  - Fixed compilation in OpenBSD (Ivo van der Sangen).
