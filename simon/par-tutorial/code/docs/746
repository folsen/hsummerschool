Presumably David thought the same. I won't deny that there is a certain 
simplifying elegance to it.

1. Conceptually, you have the same information twice.

2. I have no idea how to make Darcs do the thing with "hard links" (is 
that even supported under Windows?) I just copy the whole folder using 
the normal OS file tools.

Either way, you lose the ability to see how branches are related to each 
other, which might be useful in some cases.
