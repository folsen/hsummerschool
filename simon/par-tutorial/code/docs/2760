As, I believe, is darcs.

There's also the data ownership issue, in that I'm more likely to
trust others in the Haskell community than I am from people that make
money from the website I'm using.

*shrug* I don't see the advantage, but admittedly I don't have use for
any of these.  I more use c.h.o as a place to have a place to store
the code for others to look at if they need so, and so I can work both
at uni and at home on the same codebase.
