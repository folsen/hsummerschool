Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Munich functional programmers' UG
Message-ID: <4DA70BDC.9060605@funktional.info>

  Dear all,

last week, there have been thoughts to create a user group for 
functional programmers in Munich, Germany. People who are interessted 
can join the new mailing list:

http://www.fs.lmu.de/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/high-order-munich

The idea is to have meetings every now and then with talks on aspects of 
functional programming. However, it's not restricted to Haskell. Please 
spread the word to anyone who could be interested.

Thank you,
Heinrich
