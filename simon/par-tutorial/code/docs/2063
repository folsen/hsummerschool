I'll stick to .anansi as well then, it's rather descriptive :-)

I was probably unclear, I *really* would like to use the markdown loom
and then pass the weave through pandoc to be able to create html/latex
from the same source.  So I suspect the problem I ran into is more
related to pandoc than anansi, but I was hoping that someone among the
anansi users had run into and solved it already :-)

I might try that, but then use the markdown loom as the basis instead.
It would be nice to have a specific pandoc loom that makes use of its
extensions to markdown, where that makes sense.

It's rather easy to do in vim, e.g. by setting the filetype to
something line 'markdown.haskell'.  I haven't tried putting together
three filetypes, but I suspect it just works :-)  If I get around to
putting together an anansi syntax file for vim I'll make sure to share
it.

Perl is another example of filling a tiny, short-term need, and then
being a real problem in the longer term.
