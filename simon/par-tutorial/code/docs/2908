If you incorporate GPL code into a binary you want to distribute you
have to comply with the GPL. Static linking a GPL library will
incorporate GPL code into your binary, ergo you have to comply with
the GPL.

If you write a client of a GPL library and you want to distribute it,
your client can be any GPL compatible license - it does not have to be
GPL. Should you distribute a compiled binary you have to comply with
the GPL and any additional terms brought in by your GPL-compatible
license.

Its that simple - until there is a court ruling to decide otherwise.
