The first step would be to make a patch that works for you, and to
attach it to the ticket. Other people could verify that it works on
other platforms -- perhaps after attaching the patch you could mail
this list and ask people to check it :)

Then again if it's simply a matter of generating additional HTML text
(as opposed to styling/rendering issues) then it should be
straightforward to verify that the new content is added in the
generated files without worrying about other platforms.
