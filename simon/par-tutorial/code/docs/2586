Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANN: HackageOneFive: Reverse dependency lookup for
 all packages on Hackage
Message-ID: <20110202115742.GA5168@x200>

Hello,
I wrote a tiny Snap app that provides reverse dependency lookup for all
packages on Hackage.

A git repository is at:

    https://github.com/sol/HackageOneFive

Setup instructions are provide in the README[1] file.

It uses a PostgreSQL database for storage but it should be trivial to
port this to e.g. SQLite.

As always feedback and patches are gladly welcome!

btw: Is there still progress on Hackage 2.0?

Cheers,
Simon
