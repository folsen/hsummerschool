Hi Mukesh,

Great to hear you're trying parallel Haskell! I can't yet help debug your parallel performance, but maybe I can offer something for your last request.

Have you tried the Parallel Haskell portal?

http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Parallel

You will find some links mainly aimed at helping people to get started, and also a list of parallel Haskell readings.

Hope this helps :-)

I understood par and pseq and I wrote matrix multiplication using these two function but it does not look.  Although I did not get all these details but none of the sparks converted which is really important for parallel programming.
