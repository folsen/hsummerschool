I tend to use 'm', but you're right that it causes confusion about 
whether mFoo is "monadic foo" or "maybe foo". Perhaps I should start 
using 'mb' instead...

I'd love it if '?' were allowed as an identifier suffix, though the 
lispers will assume it's a predicate rather than a maybe. While we're at 
it, three cheers for allowing '!' as an identifier suffix for indicating 
strictness (because the apostrophe has plenty of other uses).
