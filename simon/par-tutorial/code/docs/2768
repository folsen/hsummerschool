I'm inclined to agree.

In particular, I get strange looks from people in the OOP community when 
I say I'm using a language that doesn't have any abstractions at all for 
dealing polymorphically with containers. In general, it's almost 
impossible to write a Haskell function that will work with a list, an 
(immutable) array, a hash table or a map, polymorphically.

I guess it's the case that containers has been there so long now that 
changing it would break everything. Still, I find myself hungry for 
something better.

Than again, the Prelude itself leaves several things to be desired...
