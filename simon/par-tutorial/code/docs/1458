More likely ? or ? and they got remapped to ?s by incorrect encodings.

attending non-determinism. No "OS function calls" seems way over the top.

It's not over the top; it's traditional embedded device programming, where
there isn't an OS available, just a simple BIOS (and I don't mean the MS-DOS
one).  I suppose kids these days expect even embedded environments to be
fairly high end CPUs with full memory management and full OSes... nope.
 There's even still ladder logic out there ? and at least one recent Haskell
package aimed at programming for it.
