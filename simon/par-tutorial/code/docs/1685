I wonder what profiling tells you, you should identify where your
performance problems actually are before trying to optimise.

Some things that might help are using something like Blaze-Builder[1] to
construct your bytestrings for output. I'm hoping that they're sufficiently
lazy that you can lazily read in the input, and write output as you've made
it available. if you use the blaze-builder-enumerator package, you should
be able to get exactly what you want (but probably requires some minor
knowledge of iteratees).

Anyway, without seeing your code, we can't easily tell you what's wrong.

Cheers,
Alex
