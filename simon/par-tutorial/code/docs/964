Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Declarative configuration languages?
Message-ID: <5897AB6F-0A17-45FB-9E07-4BF4E9424AC2@cs.otago.ac.nz>

A colleague just asked me
	I'm trying to kick off some work into middleware for configuration of large-scale,
	distributed systems.  Have you come across any elegant, declarative configuration
	languages used for this sort of job?

I've found a couple of papers, but I've never _used_ any of the systems.
Any recommendations?
