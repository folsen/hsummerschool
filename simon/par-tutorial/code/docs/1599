If the shell found it by $PATH search, $0 will be simply the program name
with no directory and you will have to repeat the PATH search yourself.
 (And the pathological case:  the user did "PATH=something yourprog", where
"something" does not contain the directory holding "yourprog".)

There is no 100% reliable way to get the executable without using something
like /proc/self/exe (only on Linux).
