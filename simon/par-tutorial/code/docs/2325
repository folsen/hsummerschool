Subject: [Haskell-cafe] [ANNOUNCEMENT] github 0.1.1
Message-ID: <20111227171917.GU87097@jack.mike-burns.com>

The Github API now has a fancy Haskell library for accessing it, and
this library is named: github.

  http://hackage.haskell.org/package/github
  https://github.com/mike-burns/github

The module structure reflects the Github API v3 documentation.

It currently only supports the non-authenticated parts of the API.

It does not support a few API endpoints which are documented by Github
but which don't work under a command-line curl.

I love pull requests, so send 'em!
