Message-ID: <CAFFbn6G4aus9tAjoJvyyeSqDeOJkQ_yxbKE9t9QrGr4sRocVJA@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

I try to install "cabal-install" on NetBSD.

when I launch the installation (by booststrap.sh)

and it come to Building cabal-install, it say :

Distribution/Compat/FilePerms.hs:33:4 - Not in scope:
`throwErrnoPathIfMinus1_'

Do you know how I can fix this issue ?

Thank you

Lo?c
