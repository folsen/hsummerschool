Because with `r0` you're liable to just parallel evaluate to the thunk
containing the computation you're trying to parallelize, and the actual
computation then takes place later *outside* the parallel section?  (That
is, what comes out of parList is a list of the thunks passed to `r0`,
otherwise unevaluated.  You wrapped them in an `id` and then parallel
evaluated the `id` away, real useful that. :)  You need to go at least to
WHNF, then it comes down to the strictness specified in what's passed to
`rseq`.
