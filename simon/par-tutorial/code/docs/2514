Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Copy .cabal folder to diff machine/user
Message-ID: <d292bd49-5ede-41d8-8c4e-a7751582a3e3@24g2000yqi.googlegroups.com>

Is it possible to copy .cabal and .ghc folders to different machine/
user and develop same project over there ?

Or is the only way to allow a team of developers to work on the same
project is to force each one of them to install all necessary packages
on their machines.
