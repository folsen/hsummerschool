It's always been my understanding that calculi were systems that defined particular symbols and the legal methods of their manipulation in the context of a particular calculus. The point, generally (har har), seems to be abstraction. The lambda calculus describes computation without actually implementing it, the predicate/propositional calculi describe logic without necessarily containing any explicit logical statements.

Algebras, on the other hand, are structures whose properties are defined by a (usually) small number of properties and axioms. A Boolean algebra is a 6-tuple (A, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?) such that for all a, b, c in A, associativity, commutativity, absorption, distributivity, and complement axioms all hold. An algebra over a field describes a vector space with a bilinear vector product. The other axioms that must hold depend on the particular vector space, though.
