Subject: [Haskell-cafe] How to use cabal macros in .hsc files
Message-ID: <CADLz5wXV1WA-_EaQuD71SjG44ikrZ+6i0jR-vkMfL0PV5ZA8Lw@mail.gmail.com>

Hello,

Currently it's not possible to use cabal macros like
MIN_VERSION_base(x,y,z) in .hsc files:

http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/870

Is there a workaround to get the same effect?

Regards,

Bas
