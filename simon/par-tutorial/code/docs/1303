Message-ID: <4E544F7D.8030401@gmail.com>

Hi, John, there is a space leak problem in ListLike typeclass,
in the method genericLength

calclen accum cl =
--- thank you for your nice library
btw, is there any way to derive ListLike interface automatically?
for such type :
newtype List a = List {[a]}
Best,bob
