it?s for the packaging work, here is an example:
http://packages.debian.org/changelogs/pool/main/g/ghc/ghc_7.0.4-4/changelog

But I think David is suggesting to adapt a similarly formatted changelog
file for Cabal packages, e.g. to display them on hackage. I am all for
that, as long as it does not prevent the introduction of changelogs
(e.g. by excessive bikeshedding or by having people lose interest
again).

Greetings,
Joachim
