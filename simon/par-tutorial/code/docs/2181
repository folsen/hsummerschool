The difference is really whether you care about aligning things mid-line or not, not to mention editor support (i.e. not Vim or other terminal-based editor).

Right, ASCII code that relies on monospace for such midline alignments can be quite unreadable, but otherwise it has nothing really to contribute. Non-monospace might in fact be more readable, taking away the fact that it may take some time to get used to it, since monospace has been used so much.

For such alignments, one would either to write to code so it does not depend on it, or find some other means to do it.
