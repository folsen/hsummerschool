      6th INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TEST AND PROOFS (TAP 2012)
	          http://lifc.univ-fcomte.fr/tap2012/
	      May 31 - June 1, 2012, Prague, Czech Republic

	   Part of the TOOLS Federated Conferences 2012
                http://tools2012.fit.cvut.cz/

The TAP conference is devoted to the convergence of proofs and tests,
to the application of techniques from both sides and their combination
for the advancement of software quality. Test and Proof seem to be
contradictory techniques: if you have proved your program to be
correct, it is fruitless to comb it for bugs; and if you are testing
it, that is surely a sign that you have given up on any hope to prove
its correctness.  Accordingly, proofs and tests have, since the onset
of software engineering research, been pursued by distinct
communities.

However, the development of both approaches lead to the discovery of
common issues and to the realization that each may need the other. The
emergence of model checking has been one of the first signs that
contradiction may yield to complementarity. Further evidence give test
data generation techniques from models or programs which boil down to
constraint resolution techniques for relatively large formula; the
advent of powerful SMT solvers have therefore powered new testing
techniques.  Finally, since formal, proof-based verification is
costly, testing invariants and background theories can be helpful to
detect errors early and to improve cost effectivity.  Summing up, in
the past few years an increasing number of research efforts have
encountered the need for combining proofs and tests, dropping earlier
dogmatic views of incompatibility and taking instead the best of what
each of these software engineering domains has to offer.

The TAP conference aims to bring together researchers and practitioners
working in the converging fields of testing and proving, and will offer
a generous allocation of papers, panels and informal discussions.

Topics of interest cover theory definitions, tool constructions and 
experimentations and include (other topics related to TAP are welcome):
- Transfer of concepts from testing to proving (e.g., coverage criteria)
  and from proving to testing
- Program proving with the aid of testing techniques
- New problematics in automated reasoning emerging from specificities
  of test generation
- Verification and testing techniques combining proofs and tests
- Generation of test data, oracles, or preambles by deductive
  techniques such as: theorem proving, model checking, symbolic
  execution, constraint logic programming
- Model-based testing and verification
- Generation of specifications by deduction
- Automatic bug finding
- Debugging of programs combining static and dynamic analysis
- Formal frameworks
- Tool descriptions and experience reports
- Case studies combining tests and proofs
- Applying combination of test and proof techniques to new application 
  domains such as validating security procotols or vulnerability
  detection of programs
