You can also take a look at the demo programs in the cairo
package:

bash $ mkdir /tmp/uncabal && cd /tmp/uncabal
bash $ cabal unpack cairo
bash $ cd /tmp/uncabal/cairo-*/demo
bash $ runghc StarAndRing.hs

The gtk2hs bindings are generaly pretty dumb and just mimic the
original C behaviour. So the best source of documentation is
the original cairo website:
    http://cairographics.org/documentation/
