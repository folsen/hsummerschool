Subject: [Haskell-cafe] plugins and cabal build
Message-ID: <BANLkTimugDfWXFb0-HepHGqGOyspQAztLg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

I'm experimenting with using the plugins package for yesod devel
server. The basic approach is to use cabal for building the object
files, and then load them with plugins. I can get everything to work
when I compile with "ghc --make", but I believe name mangling is
getting in the way with the "cabal build" route. Can someone give some
guidance on how to properly mangle the function names so that plugins
can load them?

Thanks,
Michael
