I can't say that I have cared about that sort of thing in a very long
time. Bits are rather cheap these days. I store data on disk, and the
space it occupies is whatever it is; I don't worry about it.

I'm not sure I understand this one. I generally don't need _any_
randomness to compute a value. On the other hand, if the desire is to
take an integer n and generate a set of pseudorandom numbers ranging
from 0 to n-1, that's easily done using the standard random number
methods.
