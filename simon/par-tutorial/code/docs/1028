  I do not associate more laws, but I expect to use zero for things that 
are somehow related to numbers. And I also do not want to use (+) and (-), 
say, for rational numbers to mean (*) and (/). That's not an algebraical 
reason, but a matter of error prevention and expectations.
  It's the same reason, why I would not want to define an Ord instance for 
Complex numbers. Complex numbers can be ordered, but a < (b::Complex 
Rational) will be a mistake in many cases, I guess.
