that would be quite useful for those who want to distribute executables!

may i also suggest the following feature: collect all the copyright notices and
license files from each dependency (many licenses require those to be displayed
and distributed along with the executable) and optionally bundle them with the
applicaton's data-files? i briefly looked into this, but couldn't find a way to
retrieve the installed License-File from ~/.cabal using Cabal. doing this by
hand turns out to be quite tedious when there are many dependencies ...
