Hello,

In addition of the (unpacked) archive, you also need to provide a
00-index.tar.gz file.

It is an archive with all the .cabal that are available in the repo.
You can find info about its layout at the following page
http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/wiki/HackageDB

I don't know if such a index file is available for the archive.tar you
have, but it should be straightforward to create it.

HTH,
Thu
