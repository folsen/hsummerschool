If we keep the capability to build both, and come up with a good way
to use the platform default, this would be the biggest advantage for
OS X users. (Full disclosure: speaking as a Snow Leopard user). Also,
as time goes on, we will be seeing more, not less, 64-bit OS X users
and releases.

I'd be interested to see how much this happens in practice, but it
does seem to be a big concern.

The compilers/linkers for most languages supported on OS X support
generating "universal" binaries with both 32- and 64- bit code. I
wonder if this is something GHC could support?
