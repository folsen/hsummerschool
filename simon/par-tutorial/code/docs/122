No, I mean that compliant compilers should only support UTF-8. I don't
see a reason to allow the creation of Haskell files that can only be
read by some compilers.

I don't know about that, but I'd be very surprised if there are any
editors out there that don't support UTF-8. If a user is
inconvenienced once because he/she needs to change the default
encoding to UTF-8, and the result is all Haskell files share the same
encoding, I'm OK with that.

@Colin: Even if UTF-16 was more space-efficient than UTF-8 (which I
highly doubt[1]), I'd be incredibly surprised if this held true for
Haskell source, which will almost certainly be at least 90%
code-points below 128. For those code points, UTF-16 is twice the size
as UTF-8.
