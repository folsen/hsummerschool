Very fancy! I am a big fan of Xournal, so I will have to take this for a spin.

> http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xournal-parser
> http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xournal-render

> Installing hxournal should be very simple:

> > cabal install hxournal
> 
> hxournal can be currently regarded as a clone of xournal, which is a
> notetaking program developed in C. (See
> http://xournal.sourceforge.net)
> 
> As xournal, hxournal can take wacom tablet X11 input in subpixel unit
> so that it can result in very smooth notetaking experience.

> Currently, basic pen operations and eraser operations, file open/save
> operations, rectangular selection, cut/copy/paste operations have been
> implemented. So the application is semi-usable. The file format is
> the same as xournal but gunzipped. So to view/edit xoj files generated
> from xournal, just gunzip the xoj files and read them in hxournal.
> Gunzipped xoj files generated from hxournal are readable in xournal
> program.

> One NEW special feature of hxournal compared with xournal:
> This program can make a split view (horizontal and vertical and
> arbitrary combination of them) of the same document similarly to emacs
> buffers and windows. Please try Horizontal/Vertical Split in View menu
> of the program. This will be convenient when notetaking a long
> document.
> 
> The git repository is located at https://www.github.com/wavewave/hxournal
> The program web page and development web/wiki pages will be announced
> soon (it will be linked from package webpage on hackage anyway) and
> the detailed manual will be presented there.
> 
> Thank you for your interest.
> Enjoy haskell notetaking!
