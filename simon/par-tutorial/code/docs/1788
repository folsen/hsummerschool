Subject: [Haskell-cafe] web-routes-quasi: Generating a route type
Message-ID: <20111209174808.26544db2@angst.streitmacht.eu>

Hello there,

I'm trying to use the web-routes-quasi package outside of Yesod.  Is
there any documentation on how to use TH to generate a route type just
like Yesod does?  Or is that a Yesod-specific feature?

I don't need the actual automatic dispatch or anything, just a type to
work with.  If it's not possible, I will just go ahead and (ab-) use the
constructor strings.


Greets,
Ertugrul
