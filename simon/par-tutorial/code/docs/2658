I don't know if this is relevant, but I thought that the GHC compiler
believes that all exceptions are equivalent and indistinguishable -
that is, in the presence of multiple exceptional code-paths it will
make optimizations that would not otherwise otherwise be sound.

That might not be the issue here, but it is interesting.
