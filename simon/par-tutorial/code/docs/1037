Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANNOUNCE: Chell: A quiet test runner (low-output
	alternative to test-framework)

Hi John,

I am wondering if you have seen the hspec package? [1] It seems to solve all
the problems you are with chell, including that it silences Hunit output. We
are using it for all the Yesod tests now.

Thanks,
Greg Weber
