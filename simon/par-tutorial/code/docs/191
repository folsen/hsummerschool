Quotes of the Week

     * lispy: [in response to "C++ is a huge language, the type system is
       complex"] real and imaginary components :) the imaginary bits are
       the type safety

     * gwern: amazing `catch` (how sweet the type), that saved an
       exception like me! I once was thrown, but now am caught; was
       impure, but now pure be

     * hpc: appEndo sounds like a harry potter spell

     * monochrom: yeah, get out of Turing tarpit, provable termination,
       only to get into Godel tarpit

     * xplat: to me, the great thing about pointfree programming is you
       don't have to let variable names get in the way of your logic. and
       the great thing about pointful programming is you don't have to let
       '(flip .) . (.) . (flip flip . join)' get in the way of your logic.
       it's nice to have multiple tools in your toolbox

     * lispy: I've never looked at the gtk2hs source. I'm not sure I can
       muster the intestinal fortitude

     * kmc: time to play "transfinite ordinal or asian emoticon"

     * killing-joke: rip oop. "Object-oriented programming is eliminated
       entirely from the introductory curriculum, because it is both
       anti-modular and anti-parallel by its very nature, and hence
       unsuitable for a modern CS curriculum."
