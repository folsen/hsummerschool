So, I was able to make my link errors go away, by adding `-shared' to my
command line:

dbanas at dbanas-eeepc:~/prj/haskell/AMIParse/trunk$ make
ghc -no-hs-main -shared -dynamic -o ami_test -L. -lami ami_test.o

However, when I try to execute the resultant program, I get a
segmentation fault:

dbanas at dbanas-eeepc:~/prj/haskell/AMIParse/trunk$ ./ami_test test.ami 
Segmentation fault

Tracing this shows that the `main' pointer of the program appears to be
NULL:

dbanas at dbanas-eeepc:~/prj/haskell/AMIParse/trunk$ gdb --args ./ami_test
test.ami

I assume that's because of the `-shared' flag.

Any thoughts?
