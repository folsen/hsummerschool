"cab" is just a wrapper for "cabal" and "cabal-dev" for installation.
So, I have no idea about what's going on.

Please try "cab install <package> -n" to see what will happen before
typing "cab install <package>". If you find the word "reinstall", you
should not install the package because the installation operation will
break your package environment.

You can analyze package dependency with:
cab deps <package> -r
cab revdeps <package> -r
cab list -r

Adding the "-a" option displays global packages also.

I recommend to use a sandbox when you try to resolve a dependency
problem.
