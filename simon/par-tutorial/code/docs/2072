I just thought I'd mention that I've solved this particular issue now.
All that was needed was to make sure that

    \usepackage{aeguill}

was added to the generated LaTeX.  Personally I did that by putting
the line in a file and then use the -H argument to `markdown2pdf`
which pandoc provides.

Most software today is very much like an Egyptian pyramid with
millions of bricks piled on top of each other, with no structural
integrity, but just done by brute force and thousands of slaves.
