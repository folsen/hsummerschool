Yes, first thing would be to check the log files.  Oh, wait, users don't
have read permissions for those...

And we all know where that road leads - to frustration and low quality
services, that's where.

Sorry for my grumpiness - this is a constant struggle for me. :-)

Perhaps 'cabal update' should provide some visual feedback by default?
There's -v, but there's still a noticable pause (15 seconds on a fairly
beefy computer and a good connection) between "Downloaded to [..]" and
"Reading available packages...".

The index is 3MB, it's probably not big enough that a smarter protocol
(rsync/rdiff?) would improve things?  Except perhaps checking that it
has been updated since the last update - that'd probably save a ton of
bandwidth if/when people do automatic updates.
