This is possibly the most important point to emphasise, of which many  
people seem unaware.  If you expect to receive an open source  
application from someone else as source code, and build it yourself,  
then almost by the definition of Open Source, you are already in  
compliance with all licences.

It is only those, comparatively few, people who build binaries and  
give them to other people *as binaries* who even need to think about  
licensing issues.
