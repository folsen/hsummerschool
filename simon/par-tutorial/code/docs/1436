Okay, I should have waited until morning to post this... so actually,
things still work fine when I build without profiling.  However, when I
build with profiling, I get the segfault.  I'm guessing either I need to
set different dynamic flags with the profiling build to match the
options of the compiler that built the executable... or perhaps it's
still impossible to do what I'm looking for with profiling enabled.
Does anyone know which is the case?
