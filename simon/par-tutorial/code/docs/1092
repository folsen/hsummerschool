Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Array and Ix for custom Graph ADT
Message-ID: <FB1023D2-50B4-4E73-B0A2-0BEFFBBCD834@chariot.net.au>

Hi,

I'm creating a Graph data structure, and I want to use the array list approach, implemented as an Array.

I need my Nodes to be instances of Ix for this to work and my Node type is roughly as follows:

data Node = MyNode Int [Int] Type1 Type2

(Type1 and Type2 are nullary algebraic datatypes--enumerations in other words)

How can I "index" the Array with an instance of a Node. I think I need to make Node an instance of Ix somehow??

Is this a sensible approach? Sample code of the instance declaration for Ix would be helpful.


Thanks
