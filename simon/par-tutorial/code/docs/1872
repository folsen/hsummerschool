You just need to use flags.  Something like

Flag usethis
  Description:  Use this instead of that
  Default:  False

Library
  Build-depends: ...everything else...
  if flag(usethis)
    Build-depends: this == 0.1.*
  else
    Build-depends: that == 4.0.*

You don't need to care about usethis.  If 'that' is not installed but
'this' is, Cabal will automatically turn 'usethis' flag on.

Cheers,
