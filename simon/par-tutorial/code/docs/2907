Well, the obvious distinction is that a dynamically linked executable
doesn't actually contain any code from its libraries, while a statically
linked one does.

I disagree - the linked executable must, but not the wrapper by itself.
It's source code, i.e. text, thus a creative work, and therefore
covered by copyright - on its own.

So this may be a problem for distributions, which ship compiled and
linked binaries.  But generally not for authors, darcs repositories or
Hackage, which only ship source code.

I guess you could conceivably say that compiling downloaded source code
constitutes copying, and is thus limited under copyright.  But I think
all the relevant licenses would be considered to allow this.

If, and only if, you wish to distribute the final executable.

Yes.  At least, it'd be nice if Cabal would tell you about the licenses
involved. But I'd let people do their own interpretations, that's too
much of a minefield.
