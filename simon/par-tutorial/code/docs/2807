We have restored read-only access to the majority of projects on:
code.haskell.org		(code repositories)
projects.haskell.org		(project webspace)

A small number have been held back because they contain .js, .html
or .tar.gz snapshots that are not recorded in any repository. We will
ask project owners to check these before they are restored.
