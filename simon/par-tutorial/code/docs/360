You cannot create debug symbols. Things that are possible:

 1. You may use the -debug flag to GHC to link with the debug RTS,
which has full debugging information for GDB. Note that this only lets
you debug the *RTS*, not any of the code you wrote

 2. Use GDB to debug your Haskell code without giving it any symbols
or understanding of the Haskell calling conventions. This is very
difficult. Information on this is on the GHC wiki:
http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Debugging/CompiledCode?redirectedfrom=DebuggingGhcCrashes

 3. Use the GHCi debugger, which does actually work surprisingly well:
http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.0.3/html/users_guide/ghci-debugger.html

Cheers,
