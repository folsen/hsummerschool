Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Sharing a room for the CRA-W/CDC/SIGPLAN Mentoring
	Workshop at POPL?
Message-ID: <1323635957.2897.8.camel@kirk>

Hi,

I will attend the CRA-W/CDC/SIGPLAN Mentoring Workshop at POPL next
year, and will have to share a room with another attendee. As we can
give preferences, I was wondering if another Haskeller might be in the
same position and interested in sharing a room.

Greetings,
Joachim
