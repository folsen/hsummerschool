Seconded.

Sometimes I wish for a -fphp flag that would turn some type errors into
warnings. Example: 

v.hs:8:6:
    Couldn't match expected type `[a]' against inferred type `()'
    In the first argument of `a', namely `y'
    In the expression: a y
    In the definition of `c': c = a y

GHC could substitute 'y = error "Couldn't match expected type `[a]' against
inferred type `()'"' and compile anyway.

Would that bring Haskell closer to Python?
