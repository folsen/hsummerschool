I think the reason it gets disabled is typically well intentioned.
Besides, if someone is trying to debug http protocol issues using
ICMP, they're taking an awfully indirect route.

Good to know.

All of those are plausible, but I heard one of the servers needed some
help restarting.  I don't know enough about the network topology and
setup (or what was wrong with the server) to understand why would
cause the behavior Greg was seeing.  I do know that several other
people were able to run 'cabal update' during that time.

The whole thing seems a bit odd to me, but should be behind us for now.
