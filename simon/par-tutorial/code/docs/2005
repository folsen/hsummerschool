Hi,

As mentioned in the committee's annual report
(http://haskellorg.wordpress.com/2011/10/26/first-year-report/), our
attempt to join SFC has stalled because they don't have the capacity to
accept new projects at the moment.

We therefore applied to join SPI (http://www.spi-inc.org/), and they
have now offered us "associated project" status
(http://www.spi-inc.org/projects/associated-project-howto/).

We intend to accept this offer, but are taking this final opportunity to
seek feedback from the community before doing so.

SPI is very like SFC in what it does and how it operates, so we don't
expect this to make any substantial differences to the FAQ quoted below.

Regards,

Ganesh
on behalf of the haskell.org committee
