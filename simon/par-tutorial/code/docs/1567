Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Data structure
Message-ID: <CA+LmyckE5nLBUiaKthy271fHvdeTbz56+6HL+jO0=DC=dFrpxQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi guys,

I want to compare data structure between Haskell, Java, Lisp and C. I am
wondering if I could compare list comprehention in haskell with the vector
class in Java, macros in common lisp and dynamic arrays in C.

Thanks,
Julita
