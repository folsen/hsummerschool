Kazu,

thanks I wanted to mention that the "unknown symbol" error is very
likely not related to the cab tool as the same error appears, when
using the cabal - tool. I guess we can ignore it even in the context
of my main question, sorry for being to verbose. What I found more
interesting is, that cab doesn't try to re-install an installed
package - already in the database too, as ghc-pkg output pretends -
which is expected behaviour. The cabal system frontend obviously does
trying to reinstall the package though. This seems like different
model of reality...

Cheers
Daniel
