Please stop or quote someone.

Yes, and if you throw up enough verbiage or move goalposts enough you 
(impersonal) can tire anyone. That doesn't prove anything.

I dislike C++. There's one reason for that: "Undefined behavior". 
Haskell still has some of that, but as long as you steer clear of 
unsafePerformIO, you're mostly good.

I really don't care if you like or dislike Haskell, nor does anyone else 
AFAICT. Thinking is good. Debating is also fine as long as you're 
prepared to listen what people are saying.

Conal Elliot was right -- at least about the debate part :)

That really *is* my last post on this thread.
