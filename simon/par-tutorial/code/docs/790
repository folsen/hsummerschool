I think there won't be consensus in many cases, otherwise developers
wouldn't have started to develop alternatives to existing packages.
However if you did the work of comparing some libraries for the same
purpose - how about writing a personal comparison in the HaskellWiki?

For the special case of CSV parsing I would of course recommend my
spreadsheet package because it parses lazily. :-)
