Subject: [Haskell-cafe] hsc2hs not using foreign.c types?
Message-ID: <AANLkTikgXJX+g75Y-JrwVymHxO-hrjXqbvfaxJq8a5X-@mail.gmail.com>

I'm just now trying to figure out how to use the FFI, along with hsc2hs.

When I use the #type ... directive in my .hsc files to pull in a c
typedef that is aliased to an integer, it puts in "Word32" instead of
CInt. I was hoping to use this in my foreign imports:

Two questions:
- Can I declare a foreign import of a c function that takes a c 'int'
to have a 'word32' input type in Haskell and will that function
correctly?
- Why doesn't hsc2hs use 'CInt' instead?
