This looks useful, thanks! I'll try it out and let you know if I have
problems.

Installing with GHC 7.2, I needed to relax some upper bounds in cabal files
of dependencies (maintainers CC'ed).

  - email-validate and ranges specify base < 4.4 but also seem to work with
base < 5.
  - yesod-json specifies blaze-textual < 0.2 but also seems to work with
blaze-textual < 0.3

Additionally, I linked /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6 to /usr/lib/libstdc++.so
before I could successfully install tkyprof. Not sure about the
consequences..

Cheers,
Sebastian
