Of course -- if you just have a starting seed and the rest of the 
sequence is known from there. I was thinking of e.g. those "periodic 
re-initialization" ways of doing RNG.

I've heard this a lot from physicists -- of course if you run a 
simulation reproducibility can be extremely important (e.g. for 
double-checking computations across different machines). However, if 
you're doing crypto it may not be so desirable :).

Anyway, I'm out of this thread too :).
