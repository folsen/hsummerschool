Yes - 5% goes to SPI to cover their overheads. It's detailed in
http://www.spi-inc.org/projects/associated-project-howto/ but not on
their donations page at http://www.spi-inc.org/donations/.

5% seems reasonable to me and in line with what similar "donation
aggregators" charge, for example the Charities Aid Foundation in the UK
charges 4%:

In effect we've been getting the admin for free from Galois up till now,
but it's been getting too troublesome for them.

Cheers,

Ganesh
