Subject: [Haskell-cafe] is ppc64 arch registerised
Message-ID: <1301657428.14636.0.camel@skalniknb>

Hi all,
I've read on this page

http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Platforms

the ppc64 arch is registerised.

I succeeded to build ghc-7.0.2 on ppc64 (Fedora) with
GhcUnregisterised=YES. Switching off this option currently leads to
failure. 

I'd like to know:

- is the info about registerised ppc64 arch still valid?

- could you provide me tips how to build it registerised?

Thanks

Skalnik
