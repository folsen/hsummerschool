Subject: [Haskell-cafe] parallel-haskell mailing list
Message-ID: <20110414155925.GB7267@dewdrop.local>

Hi everybody,

I thought I should point out that there is a mailing list dedicated to
parallelism and concurrency in Haskell.  The group exists to bring
together the various groups in the Haskell community that are working on
parallelism. It is intended to provide some visibility into the various
efforts and to encourage collaboration.  So if you want to know what's
going on in the parallel Haskell world, this is the place to hang out.

You can join the list by sending an email to

   parallel-haskell+subscribe at googlegroups.com

You can also visit the group on the web at

   http://groups.google.com/group/parallel-haskell

Or for those of you who prefer GMane

   http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.haskell.parallel

Enjoy!

Eric
