Oh, right. I haven't checked my mailbox recently...

AC-Vector-Fancy is merely a "fancy" facard over AC-Vector. So the bug is 
actually with AC-Vector.

Looking at my source code, the true bug is in Data.BoundingBox.Range 
[which provides the engine that all the other bounding box types use). 
The actual bug turns out to by face-slappingly stupid: it's a typo in 
one of the variable names.

I'll go get that fixed... and then maybe write some QuickCheck properties.
