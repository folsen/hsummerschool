Subject: [Haskell-cafe] ANN: bindings to xfconf-4.8.0.0
Message-ID: <20110415182357.GA19646@X52D.localdomain>

Hi all,

I'm very happy to announce my first hackageDB package: xfconf[0], a
Haskell binding to the XFCE xfconfd configuration d?mon.

It's mainly a pet project I have done to learn Haskell using the
FFI and QuickCheck but if someone can find it useful or
instructive I would be happy.

This package allows easy access to your favorite XFCE desktop settings
(wallpaper, colors, police, etc.) and easier synchronisations between
the configuration backend and your own Gtk+2 widget properties (a
feature missing in gconf but now part of gsettings).

A practical use of this binding can be found in hThemes[1], a
quick&dirty front-end to switch between pre-defined desktop themes (eg.
switching from a light-white theme for daytime to a dark-black one for
your nightly hack sessions).

Thanks to Andy Stewart and Axel Simon for their help in integrating
xfconf to the gtk2hs stack.

Any comments on this first work are welcomed ,-)

regards,
