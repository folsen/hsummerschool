This worked for me! Thank you so very much for taking the time to send 
this and include the explanation of how it works. Not only did I get 
this working with my emacs, but I also got Kazu Yamamoto's ghc-mod 0.5.3 
working, so now I have Haskell Flymake in my haskell-mode too. Great!

Thanks again.
