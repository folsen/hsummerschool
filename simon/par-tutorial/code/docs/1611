The 'could not create compact unwind' message is a known (and still
outstanding) linking issue on OS X. It should be harmless - it refers
to the fact that OS X 10.6 uses "compact unwind info" for exceptions
instead of DWARF unwind information, when possible. The exact cause
isn't (yet) known. Generally this just means that the exception
information falls back to being DWARF-based.

If you want to blow away all your local packages, say:

$ rm -rf ~/.ghc

Note that will blow away every local package for every GHC version. If
you have multiple versions installed, you should look in that
directory first and then blow away the appropriate subdirectory (named
something like '<arch>-darwin-<ghc-ver>'.)
