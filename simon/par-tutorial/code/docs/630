Of course, naming will always be a matter of taste. For instance I would 
not write maybe_something, because I prefer camel case, that is, 
maybeSomething. On the other hand, I already wrote some Wiki articles that 
you may read as suggestions for certain naming conventions:
   http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Qualified_names
   http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Pairs_of_identifiers
  and other articles in Category:Style. You may add an article for 
suggestions of how to name lists, maybes, eithers etc.
