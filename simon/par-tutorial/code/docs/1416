Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Ambiguous module name `System.Directory'

One other solution on this one: upgrade system-fileio. The newest
version does not contain any conflicting names.

As a side point, system-fileio (and system-filepath, which it depends
upon) are both excellent packages, I use them all the time at work.
