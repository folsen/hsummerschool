Is the haskell-mode that comes out of the box with emacs (v 23.3) the one
you folk use or do you use something more specific/uptodate?  How to find
out? [There should be a haskell-mode-version...]

To the folks from the (hesitating) vi-camp: Whatever you use, please take
time to familiarize yourself with ghci.  Its my finding that the majority
of vi aficionados imagine that programming is invariably tied to
- having a main
- built with make
- run from a shell
- back to vi

This is way less performant than the tight feedback that an interpreter
gives.  And for that ghci in an 'inferior' emacs buffer is better than
anything else (for me).

However vi-users can (probably?) use two shells -- one for vi, one for ghci
