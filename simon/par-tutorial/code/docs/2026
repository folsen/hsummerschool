What about just replying with this one link:
http://www.haskellers.com/

As thumb of rule it takes half the time to review code compared to
writing it (Don't remember where I read it ..).

Thus even RoR can be a lock in and delay updates if stuff changes.
The only chance is creating a team and provide services as "team".

But in the end its a matter of costs: If you have to share ideas - if
you have to keep each other up to date it'll take more time and somebody
has to pay for it in the end..

Its not only a Haskell vs RoR qusetion IMHO.
