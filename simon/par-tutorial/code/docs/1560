As counter-intuitive as it may seem, explaining something to somebody 
else forces you to order your thoughts and think through the knowledge 
you already have, so that you can present it to somebody else in 
something resembling a coherant form. It's not unusual for this process 
to clarify your own knowledge.

At least, that's *my* excuse for constantly talking to myself... >_>
