Subject: [Haskell-cafe] Typechecking Using GHC API
Message-ID: <CAAN2PXNTn6g_baMPDwOgiEfF0zO6KeE+PaF_NwwuwtS11T1+=w@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I do some pre-processing on a normal Haskell code ( -F ). The pre-processor
needs to know the type of each expression.
What are the possibilities to do so?
Can I use GHC API to employ GHC type checker? If yes, any good tutorial?
Is it too naive to think of a function, f :: String -> AnnotatedAST , that
takes Haskell code and returns its corresponding abstract syntax tree
annotated with types?

Thanks,
 /shayan
