Hi Jose,

 > I'm happy to announce the release of xmobar 0.14.

previous versions of xmobar used to compile fine with GHC 6.10.4, but
the new version no longer does:

    src/Parsers.hs:163:52:
        Couldn't match expected type `Char' against inferred type `[Char]'
          Expected type: GenParser Char st Char
          Inferred type: GenParser Char st String
        In the second argument of `($)', namely `wrapSkip $ string "Run"'
        In a stmt of a 'do' expression:
              notFollowedBy $ wrapSkip $ string "Run"

The complete log is at <http://hydra.nixos.org/build/1603134/nixlog/1/raw>,
just in case there happens to be an easy fix for that error.

Thank you very much for your efforts!

Take care,
Peter
