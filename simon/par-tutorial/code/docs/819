Hi Daniel,

that seemed to be a real odyssey. I will try to install the statistics
package 
when I find time. Guess it is this one on hackage:
http://hackage.haskell.org/package/statistics.
Just some remarks:
In case of problems with metadata it is helpful to stop the GUI and call
leksah-server from the command line. (leksah-server -s collects metainfo for
new packages).
What happens then is that leksah-server calls GHC-API and Haddock as a
library, which itself uses GHC-API.
So its a bit like running Haddock on a package, which usually may fail, but
it is uncommon to have this kind of problems. (It happened one time before
with a type level library, which defined all integers between 1 and several
thousands...).

J?rgen 

PS: The server at leksah.org has reached its limit yesterday, the Windows
installer alone was downloaded about 2000 times! But it should work now.
