In my tutorial on using vectors,

http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Numeric_Haskell:_A_Vector_Tutorial

There's some examples:

http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Numeric_Haskell:_A_Vector_Tutorial#Impure_Arrays

that work in IO, and should work equally well in ST (as vectors are
parameterized by either primitive monad).
